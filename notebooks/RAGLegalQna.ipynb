It makes the Code\\nuniversal in its application to every person in any part of India for every act or omission\\ncontrary to the provisions of the Code.\\nSection 2 read with section 4 of the IPC, 1860 makes the provisions of the Code\\napplicable to the offences committed \"in any place without and beyond\" the territory of\\nIndia; (1) by a citizen of India or (2) on any ship or aircraft registered in India,\\nirrespective of its location, by any person not necessarily a citizen. Such a declaration\\nwas made as long back as in 1898. By an amendment in 2009 to the said section, the\\nCode is extended to any person in any place \"without and beyond the territory of India\",\\ncommitting an offence targeting a computer resource located in India.13.\\n1. \\'Every person\\'.—Every person is made liable to punishment, without distinction of\\nnation, rank, caste or creed, provided the offence with which he is charged has been\\ncommitted in some part of India. A foreigner who enters the Indian territories and thus,\\naccepts the protection of Indian laws virtually gives an assurance of his ﬁdelity and\\nobedience to them and submits himself to their operation.

A foreigner who commits an offence within India is guilty and can be', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"punished as such without any limitation as to his corporal presence in India at the\\ntime.14. Indian Courts have jurisdiction against foreigners residing in foreign countries\\nbut their acts connected with transaction or part of transaction arising in India.15.\\n[s 2.1] Corporate Criminal Liability\\nA company is liable to be prosecuted and punished for criminal offences. Although\\nthere are earlier authorities to the fact that the corporation cannot commit a crime, the\\ngenerally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and\\nother criminal process although the criminal act may be committed through its agent.\\nThe majority in the Constitution bench held that there is no immunity to the companies\\nfrom prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which\\nthe punishment is mandatory imprisonment and ﬁne.16. When imprisonment and ﬁne is\\nprescribed as punishment the Court can impose the punishment of ﬁne which could be\\nenforced against the company.17.\\nIn CBI v Blue Sky Tie-up Pvt Ltd,18. the question again came up for consideration before\\nthe Supreme Court and it was held that since the majority of the Constitution Bench\\nruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement [supra] that the company\\ncan be prosecuted even in a case where the Court can impose substantive sentence as\\nalso ﬁne, and in such case only ﬁne can be imposed on the corporate body, the contrary\\nview taken by the learned single Judge cannot be approved.\\n[s 2.2] Vicarious Liability.—\\nIndian Penal Code, save and except some matters does not contemplate any vicarious\\nliability on the part of a person. Commission of an offence by raising a legal ﬁction or\\nby creating a vicarious liability in terms of the provisions of a statute must be expressly\\nstated. The Managing Director or the Directors of the Company, thus, cannot be said to\\nhave committed an offence only because they are holders of oﬃces.19. Vicarious\\nliability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists\\nin that behalf in the statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision ﬁxing such\\nvicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the\\ncomplainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions\\nconstituting vicarious liability.20. The provisions of the Essential Commodities Act,\\n1955, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Employees' Provident Fund (Miscellaneous\\nProvision) Act, 1952, etc., have created such vicarious liability. It is interesting to note\\nthat section 14A of the 1952 Act speciﬁcally creates an offence of criminal breach of\\ntrust in respect of the amount deducted from the employees by the company. In terms\\nof the explanations appended to section 405 of the IPC, 1860 a legal ﬁction has been\\ncreated to the effect that the employer shall be deemed to have committed an offence\\nof criminal breach of trust. Whereas a person in charge of the affairs of the company\\nand in control thereof has been made vicariously liable for the offence committed by\\nthe company along with the company but even in a case falling under section 406 of\\nthe IPC, 1860 vicarious liability has been held to be not extendable to the Directors or\\noﬃcers of the company.21.\\nThere is no exception in favour of anyone in the Penal Code, but the following persons\\nare exempted from the jurisdiction of criminal Courts of every country:—\\n(a) Foreign Sovereigns.—The real principle on which the exemption, of every sovereign\\nfrom the jurisdiction of every Court, has been deduced is that the exercise of such\\njurisdiction would be incompatible with his regal dignity—that is to say, with his\\nabsolute independence of every superior authority.22.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(b) Diplomats.—United Nations Privileges and Immunities Act, 1947, and the Diplomatic\\nRelations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, gave certain diplomats, missions and their\\nmember\\'s diplomatic immunity even from criminal jurisdiction. The Diplomatic\\nRelations (Vienna Convention) Act had been enacted to give effect to the Vienna\\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. The effect of section 2 of the Act is to give\\nthe force of law in India to certain provisions set out in the Schedule to the Act.\\nA diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving\\nState. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction except\\nin the case of:\\n(i)A real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the\\nreceiving State, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the\\npurposes of the mission;\\n(ii)An action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as\\nexecutor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of\\nthe sending State;\\n(iii)An action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the\\ndiplomatic agent in the receiving State outside his oﬃcial functions.23. A\\ndiplomatic agent is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.24. Privileges and\\nimmunities are conferred on United Nations and its Representatives as well as\\non other international organisations and their representatives by the United\\nNations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947.25.\\n(c) Alien enemies.—In respect of acts of war alien enemies cannot be tried by criminal\\nCourts. If an alien enemy commits a crime unconnected with war, e.g., theft, he would\\nbe triable by ordinary criminal Courts.\\n(d) Foreign army.—When armies of one State are by consent on the soil of a foreign\\nState they are exempted from the jurisdiction of the State on whose soil they are.\\n(e) Warships.—Men-of-war of a State in foreign waters are exempt from the jurisdiction\\nof the State within whose territorial jurisdiction they are. The domestic Courts, in\\naccordance with principles of international law, will accord to the ship and its crew and\\nits contents certain immunities. The immunities can, in any case, be waived by the\\nnation to which the public ship belongs.26.\\n(f) President and Governors.—Under Article 361 of the Indian Constitution, the\\nPresident and Governors are exempt from the jurisdiction of Courts.\\n2. \\'Within India\\'.—If the offence is committed outside India it is not punishable under\\nthe Penal Code, unless it has been made so by means of special provisions such as\\nsections 3, 4, 108A, etc., of the Code. Under section179 of the Cr PC, 1973 even the\\nplace(s) wherein the consequence (of the criminal act) \"ensues\" would be relevant to\\ndetermine the Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, even the Courts within whose\\nlocal jurisdiction, the repercussion/effect of the criminal act occurs, would have\\njurisdiction in the matter. When the consequence of an act committed by a foreigner\\noutside India if ensued in India, he can be tried in India.27. Normally crime carries the\\nperson. The commission of a crime gives the Court of the place where it is committed\\njurisdiction over the person of the offender.28.\\n[s 2.3] Territorial jurisdiction.—', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The territory of India is deﬁned under Article 1 of the Constitution of India. Article 1 of\\nthe Constitution of India deals only with the geographical territory while Article 297\\ndeals with 'maritime territory'.\\nArticle 297(3) authorises the Parliament to specify from time to time the limits of\\nvarious maritime zones such as, territorial waters, continental shelf, etc. Clauses (1)\\nand (2) of the said Article make a declaration that all lands, minerals and other things\\nof value and all other resources shall vest in the Union of India.29. Section 18 of the IPC,\\n1860 deﬁnes India as the territory of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir.\\nThese territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.30. Under the General\\nClauses Act, 1897, India is deﬁned to mean all territories for the time being comprised\\nin the territory of India as deﬁned in the Constitution of India. Under the provisions of\\nArticle 297 of the Constitution of India, all lands, minerals and other things of value\\nunderlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf or the\\nexclusive economic zone of India vest in the Union. The Constitution of India does not\\nitself deﬁne the terms territorial waters, continental shelf, and exclusive economic\\nzone. Clause (3) of Article 297 states that their limits shall be such as may be speciﬁed\\nby Parliament. In 1976, Parliament implemented the amendments to the Constitution\\nof India by passing the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.31. Insofar the Republic of India is\\nconcerned, the limit of the territorial waters was initially understood to be three nautical\\nmiles. It had been extended subsequently; up to six nautical miles by a Presidential\\nproclamation dated 22 March 1952 and to 12 nautical miles by another proclamation\\ndated 30 September 1967. By The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive\\nEconomic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 80 of 1976, it was statutorily ﬁxed at 12\\nnautical miles. Section 3 of the Act stipulates that the sovereignty of India extends to\\nthe territorial waters, the limit of which is 12 nautical miles. Section 5 of the Territorial\\nWaters Act, 1976 deﬁnes the contiguous zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent\\nto territorial waters to a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the\\nbaseline. Section 7 of the Act deﬁnes the Exclusive economic zone of India as an area\\nbeyond and adjacent to territorial waters up to a limit of 200 nautical miles.32.\\n[s 2.4] Jurisdiction beyond Territorial Waters\\nIn the case of British India Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Shanmughavilas Cashew\\nIndustries,33. the Supreme Court examined the effective operation of the statutes of a\\ncountry in relation to foreigners and foreign ships.\\nIn general, a statute extends territorially, unless the contrary is stated, throughout the\\ncountry and will extend to the territorial waters, and such places as intention to that effect is\\nshown. A statute extends to all persons within the country if that intention is shown. The\\nIndian Parliament, therefore, has no authority to legislate for foreign vessels or foreigners in\\nthem on the high seas. Thus a foreign ship on the high seas, or her foreign owners or their\\nagents in a foreign country, are not deprived of rights by our statutory enactment expressed\\nin general terms unless it provides that a foreign ship entering an Indian port or territorial\\nwaters and thus coming within the territorial jurisdiction is to be covered. Without anything\\nmore Indian statutes are ineffective against foreign property and foreigners outside the\\njurisdiction.\\nIt is this principle which is reﬂected in section 2(2) of the Merchant Shipping Act,\\n1958.34.\\nEarlier in Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd v UOI,35. it was held that India has been given\\nonly certain limited sovereign rights and such limited sovereign rights conferred on\\nIndia in respect of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone cannot be equated to\\nextending the sovereignty of India over the continental shelf and exclusive economic\\nzone as in the case of territorial waters.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

The notions relating to this matter have very considerably changed\\nbetween then and now during nearly a century that has elapsed.

The\\nwords of this section postulate the existence of a law that an act constituting an\\noffence in India shall also be an offence when committed outside India. Thus, taking\\npart in a marriage which is prohibited by the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 by a\\ncitizen of India beyond India is not an offence which can be punished in India.39. This\\nsection only applies to the case of a person who at the time of committing the offence\\ncharged was amenable to an Indian Court.40. Thus, an Indian citizen who committed an\\noffence outside India which was not an offence according to the laws of that country\\nwould still be liable to be tried in India if it was an offence under the Indian law.41. An\\nIndian citizen was murdered by another Indian citizen in a foreign country and the\\npolice refused to register an FIR on the ground that the offence was committed outside\\nIndia. The Court held that the refusal was illegal and directed the police to register the\\ncrime and proceed with investigation in accordance with the law. The Court observed\\nthat section 3 of the IPC, 1860 helps the authorities in India to proceed by treating the\\noffence as one committed within India. No doubt it is by a ﬁction that such an\\nassumption is made. But such an assumption was necessary for practical purposes.42.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='COMMENT—\\nThis section shows the extent to which the Code applies to offences committed\\noutside India. The Code applies to any offence committed by—\\n(1)any citizen of India in any place, wherever he may be;\\n(2)any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be; and\\n(3)any person, whether or not a citizen of India, who commits any offence, from\\nanywhere in the world, targeting a computer resource located in India.\\nHence, except for the case of an offence committed against a computer resource\\nlocated in India, to extend the scope of operation of IPC, 1860 against persons, either\\nthe offender must be a citizen of India or he must have committed the offence on any\\nship or aircraft registered in India.\\n[s 4.1] Crimes committed outside India.—\\nWhere an offence is committed beyond the limits of India but the offender is found\\nwithin its limits, then\\n(I)he may be given up for trial in the country where the offence was committed\\n(extradition) or\\n(II)he may be tried in India (extraterritorial jurisdiction).\\nWhere an offence was committed by an Indian citizen outside India, it was held that the\\noffence was punishable under the IPC, 1860. An investigation of such an offence would\\nnot require sanction of the Central Government under the proviso to section 188, Cr PC,\\n1973. But an enquiry as contemplated by section 202, Cr PC, 1973 could only be with\\nthe sanction of the Central Government.55.\\n(I) Extradition.—Extradition is the surrender by one State to another of a person desired\\nto be dealt with for crimes of which he has been accused or convicted and which are\\njusticiable in the Courts of the other State. Surrender of a person within the State to\\nanother State—whether a citizen or an alien—is a political act done in pursuance of a\\ntreaty or an arrangement ad hoc.56. Though extradition is granted in implementation of\\nthe international commitment of the State, the procedure to be followed by the Courts\\nin deciding, whether extradition should be granted and on what terms, is determined by\\nthe municipal law of the land. Extradition is founded on the broad principle that it is in\\nthe interest of civilised communities that criminals should not go unpunished and on\\nthat account, it is recognised as a part of the comity of nations that one State should\\nordinarily afford to another State assistance towards bringing offenders to justice.57.\\nThe procedure for securing the extradition from India is laid down in the Extradition Act,\\n1962.\\n(II) Extraterritorial jurisdiction.—Indian Courts are empowered to try offences\\ncommitted out of India on (A) land, (B) high seas or (C) aircraft.\\n(A) Land.—By virtue of sections 3 and 4 of the Penal Code, and section 188 of the Cr\\nPC, 1973 local Courts can take cognizance of offences committed beyond the\\nterritories of India. Where the Court is dealing with an act committed outside India by a\\ncitizen of India which would be an offence punishable under the Penal Code if it had\\nbeen committed in India, section 4 constitutes the act an offence and it can be dealt\\nwith under section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973.58. If, however, at the time of commission of', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"the offence the accused person is not a citizen of India, the provisions of section 4 of\\nthe Penal Code and section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973 have no application.59.\\nSection 188 of the Cr PC, 1973, provides that when an offence is committed outside\\nIndia—\\n(a)by a citizen of India, whether on high seas or elsewhere; or\\n(b)by any person not being such citizen on any ship or aircraft registered in India,\\nhe may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at\\nany place within India at which he may be found.\\nThe word 'found' in section 188, Cr PC, 1973 means not where a person is discovered\\nbut where he is actually present.60. A man brought to a place against his will can be\\nsaid to be found there.61. When a man is in the country and is charged before a\\nMagistrate with an offence under the Penal Code, it will not avail him to say that he was\\nbrought there illegally from a foreign country. The Bombay High Court has laid down\\nthis principle, following English precedents, in Savarkar's case.62. The accused Savarkar\\nhad escaped at Mareseilles from the custody of police oﬃcers charged with the duty of\\nbringing him from London to Bombay, but was re-arrested there and brought to Bombay\\nand committed for trial by the Special Magistrate at Nasik. The High Court held that the\\ntrial and committal were valid.63. The provisions of the IPC, 1860 have been extended\\nto offences committed by any citizen of India in any place within and beyond India by\\nvirtue of section 4 thereof. Accordingly, offences committed in Botswana by an Indian\\ncitizen would also be amenable to the provisions of the IPC, 1860 subject to the\\nlimitation imposed under the proviso to section 188 Cr PC, 1973.64. Section 4 gives\\nextraterritorial jurisdiction but as the Explanation says the acts committed must\\namount to an offence under the Penal Code.65.\\n[s 4.2] Acts done within Indian as well as foreign territory.—\\nA person who is a citizen of India is liable to be tried by the Courts of this country for\\nacts done by him, partly within and partly without the Indian territories, provided the\\nacts amount together to an offence under the Code.66.\\n(B) Admiralty jurisdiction.—The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas\\nis known as the admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the\\nhigh seas is a ﬂoating island belonging to the nation whose ﬂag she is ﬂying.\\nAdmiralty jurisdiction extends over—\\n(1)Offences committed on Indian ships on the high seas.\\n(2)Offences committed on foreign ships in Indian territorial waters.\\n(3)Piracy.\\nPower to enforce claims against foreign ships is an essential attribute of admiralty\\njurisdiction and it is assumed over such ships while they are within the jurisdiction of\\nthe High Court by arresting and detaining them. Admiralty jurisdiction of the High\\nCourts in India has been historically traced to the Charters of 1774 and 1728, as\\nsubsequently expanded and clariﬁed by the Letters Patent of 1823, 1862 and 1865 read\\nwith the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and the\\nColonial Court of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891 and preserved by section 106 of the\\nGovernment of India Act, 1915, section 223 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Article 225 of the Constitution of India. The pre-Constitution enactments have\\ncontinued to remain in force in India as existing laws.67.\\nThe High Court as a Court of Admiralty is treated as a separate entity exercising a\\ndistinct and speciﬁc or prescribed or limited jurisdiction. This reasoning is based on the\\nassumption that the continuance in force of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890\\nas an existing law carves out a distinct jurisdiction of the High Court limited in ambit\\nand eﬃcacy to what has been granted by the Admiralty Court Act 1861, and that\\njurisdiction has remained stultiﬁed ever since. This restrictive construction is not\\nwarranted by the provisions of the Constitution. Accordingly, a foreign ship falls within\\nthe jurisdiction of the High Court where the vessel happens to be at the relevant time,\\ni.e., at the time when the jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked, or, where the cause of\\naction wholly or in part arises. The Merchant Shipping Act empowers the concerned\\nHigh Court to arrest a ship in respect of a substantive right. This jurisdiction can be\\nassumed by the concerned High Court, whether or not the defendant resides or carries\\non business, or the cause of action arose wholly or in part, within the local limits of its\\njurisdiction. Once a foreign ship is arrested within the local limits of the jurisdiction of\\nthe High Court, and the owner of the ship has entered appearance and furnished\\nsecurity to the satisfaction of the High Court for the release of the ship, the\\nproceedings continue as a personal action. The conclusion is that all the High Courts in\\nIndia have inherent admiralty jurisdiction and can invoke the same for the enforcement\\nof a maritime claim.68.\\nEven while exercising extraordinary powers available under the Constitution the\\njurisdiction of the High Court is primarily circumscribed by its territorial limits, viz., the\\njurisdiction has to be in context of the territorial jurisdiction available to the High Court.\\nIf the overall scheme of IPC, 1860 (section 4), Cr PC, 1973 (section 188), The Merchant\\nShipping Act, 1958 (section 437) and the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 (section 13) are\\ntaken into consideration read with sections 2(2) and 3(15) of the Merchant Shipping\\nAct, it is apparent that for a Court, including High Court, to be vested with jurisdiction,\\nan offender or offending vessel have to be found within local territorial limits of such\\nCourt.69.\\n[s 4.3] Piracy\\nPiracy consists of any of the following acts:\\n(a)any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for\\nprivate ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft,\\nand directed:\\n(i)on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or\\nproperty on board such ship or aircraft;\\n(ii)against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the\\njurisdiction of any State;\\n(b)any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with\\nknowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;\\n(c)any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in\\nsubparagraph (a) or (b).70.\\nThe Convention on the Law of Sea known as United National Convention on the Law of\\nSea, 1982 (UNCLOS) sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and\\narmed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities.

It has changed the legal\\nconcept of continental shelf and also introduced a new maritime zone known as\\nexclusive economic zone. Exclusive economic zone is a new concept having several\\nnew features.71. The UNCLOS signed by India in 1982 and ratiﬁed on 29 June 1995,\\nencapsulates the law of the sea and is supplemented by several subsequent\\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations.\\nBefore UNCLOS came into existence, the law relating to the seas which was in\\noperation in India, was the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic\\nZone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, which spelt out the jurisdiction of the\\nCentral Government over the Territorial Waters, the Contiguous Zones and the\\nExclusive Economic Zone. The provisions of the UNCLOS are in harmony with and not\\nin conﬂict with the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, in this regard. Article 33\\nof the Convention recognises and describes the Contiguous Zone of a nation to extend\\nto 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is\\nmeasured. Similarly, Articles 56 and 57 describe the rights, jurisdiction and duties of\\nthe coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone and the breadth thereof extending to\\n20 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is\\nmeasured. This provision is also in consonance with the provisions of the 1976 Act.\\nThe area of difference between the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the\\nConvention occurs in Article 97 of the Convention which relates to the penal\\njurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation.72.\\n[s 4.4] Jurisdiction of Indian High Courts.—\\nIn view of the declaration of law made by the Supreme Court in M V Elisabeth v Harwan\\nInvestment and Trading,73. the High Courts in India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction.\\nThe offences which come within the admiralty jurisdiction are now deﬁned by the\\nMerchant Shipping Act, 1958.\\n(C) Aircraft.—The provisions of the Code are made applicable to any offence\\ncommitted by any person on any aircraft registered in India, wherever it may be.\\n[s 4.5] Liability of foreigners in India for offences committed outside its limits.\\n—\\nThe acts of a foreigner committed by him in territory beyond the limits of India do not\\nconstitute an offence against the Penal Code, and, consequently, a foreigner cannot be\\nheld criminally responsible under that Code by the tribunals of India for acts committed\\nby him beyond its territorial limits. Thus, when it is sought to punish a person, who is\\nnot an Indian subject, as an offender in respect of a certain act, the question is not\\n'where was the act committed,' but 'was that person at the time, when the act was\\ndone, within the territory of India'. For, if he was not, the act is not an offence, the doer\\nof it is not liable to be punished as an offender, and he is, therefore, not subject to the\\njurisdiction of criminal Courts.74. But if a foreigner in a foreign territory initiates an\\noffence which is completed within Indian territory, he is, if found within Indian territory,\\nliable to be tried by the Indian Court within whose jurisdiction the offence was\\ncompleted.75.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\nCHAPTER I INTRODUCTION\\nThe Indian Penal Code was drafted by the First Indian Law Commission presided over\\nby Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay. The draft underwent further revision at the hands\\nof well-known jurists, like Sir Barnes Peacock, and was completed in 1850. The Indian\\nPenal Code was passed by the then Legislature on 6 October 1860 and was enacted as\\nAct No. XLV of 1860.\\nPreamble. WHEREAS it is expedient to provide a general\\nPenal Code for India; It is enacted as follows:—\\nCOMMENT.—The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) exhaustively codiﬁes the law\\nrelating to offences with which it deals and the rules of the common law cannot be\\nresorted to for inventing exemptions which are not expressly enacted.1. It is not\\nnecessary and indeed not permissible to construe the IPC, 1860 at the present day in\\naccordance with the notions of criminal jurisdiction prevailing at the time when the\\nCode was enacted. The notions relating to this matter have very considerably changed\\nbetween then and now during nearly a century that has elapsed. It is legitimate to\\nconstrue the Code with reference to the modern needs, wherever this is permissible,\\nunless there is anything in the Code or in any particular section to indicate the\\ncontrary.2.\\n77.[[s 5] Certain laws not to be affected by this Act.\\nNothing in this Act shall affect the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and\\ndesertion of oﬃcers, soldiers, sailors or airmen in the service of the Government of\\nIndia or the provisions of any special or local law 1 .]\\nCOMMENT—\\nThis section is a saving clause to section 2. Though the Code was intended to be a\\ngeneral one, it was not thought desirable to make it exhaustive, and hence, offences\\ndeﬁned by local and special laws were left out of the Code, and merely declared to be\\npunishable as theretofore.78. Thus, the personnel of the Army, Navy and Airforce are\\ngoverned by the provisions of the Army Act, 1950, The Navy Act, 1957, and The Indian\\nAir Force Act, 1950 in regard to offences of mutiny and desertion committed by\\nthem.79.\\n1. 'Special or local law'.—A special law is a law relating to a particular subject;80.\\nwhereas a local law is a law which applies only to a particular part of the country.81.\\nThe distinction between a statute creating a new offence with a particular penalty and\\na statute enlarging the ambit of an existing offence by including new acts within it with\\na particular penalty is well settled. In the former case the new offence is punishable by\\nthe new penalty only; in the latter it is punishable also by all such penalties as were\\napplicable before the Act to the offence in which it is included. The Principle is that\\nwhere a new offence is created and the particular manner in which proceedings should\\nbe taken is laid down, then proceedings cannot be taken in any other way.82. However,\\na person cannot be punished under both the Penal Code and a special law for the same\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

This is,\\nhowever, conﬁned to cases where the offences are coincident or practically so.85.\\nThe Supreme Court issued speciﬁc guidelines regarding the interpretation of general law\\nand special law. See the Box below for these Guidelines.\\nSupreme Court Guidelines on Interpretation of General law and Special law\\n(i)When a provision of law regulates a particular subject and a subsequent law\\ncontains a provision regulating the same subject, there is no presumption that\\nthe later law repeals the earlier law. The rule-making authority while making the\\nlater rule is deemed to know the existing law on the subject. If the subsequent\\nlaw does not repeal the earlier rule, there can be no presumption of an intention\\nto repeal the earlier rule;\\n(ii)When two provisions of law — one being a general law and the other being\\nspecial law govern a matter, the court should endeavour to apply a harmonious\\nconstruction to the said provisions. But where the intention of the rule-making\\nauthority is made clear either expressly or impliedly, as to which law should\\nprevail, the same shall be given effect.\\n(iii)If the repugnancy or inconsistency subsists in spite of an effort to read them\\nharmoniously, the prior special law is not presumed to be repealed by the later\\ngeneral law. The prior special law will continue to apply and prevail in spite of\\nthe subsequent general law. But where a clear intention to make a rule of\\nuniversal application by superseding the earlier special law is evident from the\\nlater general law, then the later general law, will prevail over the prior special law.\\n(iv)Where a later special law is repugnant to or inconsistent with an earlier general\\nlaw, the later special law will prevail over the earlier general law.\\n[Maya Mathew v State of Kerala86. and P Raghava Kurup v V Ananthakumari87..]\\n[s 5.1] Contempt of Court\\nContempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Act 70 of 1971) makes it clear that, Contempt of Court\\nmeans \\'Civil contempt\\' or \\'Criminal contempt\\'.88. \\'Civil contempt\\' means wilful\\ndisobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a Court\\nor wilful breach of an Undertaking given to a Court.89. \"Criminal contempt\" means the\\npublication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible\\nrepresentations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever\\nwhich – (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise or lowers or tends to lower the authority\\nof any Court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of\\nany judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends\\nto obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.90. The provisions of this\\nAct shall be in addition to and not in derogation of, the provisions of any other law\\nrelating to contempt of Courts.91. Contempt proceeding is sui generis (of its own kind\\nor class or unique). It has peculiar features which are not found in criminal\\nproceedings. The respondent does not stand in the position of a person accused of an\\noffence. Initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondent who is already\\naccused in a criminal proceedings, does not amount to double jeopardy.92. Mens rea is\\nnot necessary for committing contempt of Court. The main ingredient of the offence of\\ncontempt of Court is the result of one\\'s contumacious act of offending the prestige and\\ndignity of the judiciary so as to lower it in the estimation of the general public. Whether\\nthe contemnor intended it or not is of no consequence.93.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

There are no curbs on the power of the High Court to punish for contempt of\\nitself except those contained in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.94. For the judiciary\\nto carry out its obligations effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly\\nentrusted the task, constitutional Courts have been given the power to punish for\\ncontempt, but greater the power; higher the responsibility.95.\\n[s 5.3] Contempt of Subordinate Courts\\nEvery High Court shall have and exercise the same jurisdiction, powers and authority, in\\naccordance with the same procedure and practice, in respect of contempt of Courts\\nsubordinate to it as it has and exercises in respect of contempt of itself provided that\\nno High Court shall take cognizance of a contempt alleged to have been committed in\\nrespect of a Court subordinate to it where such contempt is an offence punishable\\nunder the IPC, 1860 [section 10 Contempt of Courts Act, 1971]. The procedure\\nprescribed either under the Cr PC, 1973 or under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is not\\nattracted to the proceedings initiated under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act.\\nThe High Court can deal with such matters summarily and adopt its own procedure.\\nThe only caution that has to be observed by the Court in exercising this inherent power\\nof summary procedure is that the procedure followed must be fair and the contemnors\\nare made aware of the charges levelled against them and given a fair and reasonable\\nopportunity.96.\\n[s 5.4] Section 228 IPC vis-a-vis Contempt of Courts Act\\nWhat is made publishable under section 228 IPC, 186097. is the offence of intentional\\ninsult to a Judge or interruption of Court proceedings but not as a contempt of Court.\\nThe deﬁnition of criminal contempt is wide enough to include any act by a person\\nwhich would either scandalise the Court or tend to interfere with the administration of\\njustice. It would also include any act which lowers the authority of the Court or\\nprejudices or interferes with the due course of any judicial proceedings.

The\\ndeﬁnition of \"movable property\" in the section is not exhaustive.99.

Thus, salt produced on a swamp,101. and papers forming part of the record of\\na case,102. are movable property within the meaning of this section.

By severance, things that are immovable become movable; and it is\\nperfectly correct to call those things attached which can be severed; and undoubtedly it\\nis possible to sever earth from the earth and attach it again thereto. Earth, that is soil,\\nand all the component parts of the soil, inclusive of stones and minerals, when severed\\nfrom the earth or land to which it was attached, are movable property capable of being\\nthe subject of theft.104. Any part of \"the earth\", whether it is stones or sand or clay or\\nany other component, when severed from \"the earth\", is movable property.105. Standing\\ncrop, so long as it is attached to the earth is not movable property as deﬁned in the\\nCode, but the moment it is severed from the earth its character is changed and it can\\nbecome the subject of theft.106.\\nFish in any water are corporeal property and they become subject of theft as soon as\\nthey are separated from the waters, dead or alive, and are moved.107.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

Unless there is wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss\\nto another, an act would not be \\'dishonest\\'. Wrongful gain includes wrongful retention\\nand wrongful loss includes being kept out of the property as well as being wrongfully\\ndeprived of property.117. An act done with the intention to cause \\'wrongful gain\\' can be\\nsaid to be dishonest.118. Deceit is not an ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word\\n\"dishonestly\". \"Dishonestly\" involves a pecuniary or economic gain or loss.119. Thus,\\n\"dishonestly\" means an intention to cause either wrongful gain or wrongful loss. So\\nwhere municipal oﬃcers demolished and removed an unauthorised structure lawfully\\nby virtue of powers given to them under the Municipal Act, it could not be said that they\\ncommitted the offence of theft under section 380, IPC, 1860, as their act was not\\ncommitted dishonestly within the meaning of section 24 read with section 23, IPC,\\n1860.

Fraud and deception are synonymous.127.\\nTo \\'defraud\\' or do something fraudulently is not by itself made an offence under the\\nPenal Code, but various acts when done fraudulently (or fraudulently and dishonestly)\\nare made offences. These include:\\n(i)Fraudulent removal or concealment of property (sections 206, 421, 424)\\n(ii)Fraudulent claim to property to prevent seizure (section 207).\\n(iii)Fraudulent suffering or obtaining a decree (sections 208 and 210)\\n(iv)Fraudulent possession/delivery of counterfeit coin (sections 239, 240, 242 and\\n243).\\n(v)Fraudulent alteration/diminishing weight of coin (sections 246–253)\\n(vi)Fraudulent acts relating to stamps (sections 261–261)\\n(vii)Fraudulent use of false instruments/weight/measure (sections 264–266)\\n(viii)Cheating (sections 415–420)\\n(ix)Fraudulent prevention of debt being available to creditors (section 422).\\n(x)Fraudulent execution of deed of transfer containing false statement of\\nconsideration (section 423).\\n(xi)Forgery making or executing a false document (sections 463–471 and 474)', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(xii)Fraudulent cancellation/destruction of valuable security, etc. (section 477)\\n(xiii)Fraudulently going through marriage ceremony (section 496).\\nIt follows therefore, that by merely alleging or showing that a person acted fraudulently,\\nit cannot be assumed that he committed an offence punishable under the Code or any\\nother law, unless that fraudulent act is speciﬁed to be an offence under the Code or\\nother law.128.\\nThe expression \\'defraud\\' involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person\\ndeceived. The injury may even comprise a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. Even in\\nthose rare cases where the beneﬁt to the deceiver does not cause corresponding loss\\nto the deceived, the second condition is satisﬁed.129. The expression \"intent to deceive\"\\nis different from the expression \"intent to defraud\".130. \"Intent to defraud\" is established\\nonly when the deception has as its aim some advantage or the likelihood of advantage\\nto the person who causes the deceit or some kind of injury or the possibility of injury to\\nanother.131. Thus, where an expert deposing before a court as a defence witness was\\nasked to produce his credentials before the court and it appeared from the documents\\nproduced that they were not genuine, it was held that as he acted under the orders of\\nthe court and not voluntarily, it could not be said that his intention was to cause any\\none to act to his disadvantage. In the circumstances, he did not act with \"intent to\\ndefraud\". He was, therefore, held liable under sections 193 and 196 but not under\\nsections 465 and 471, IPC, 1860.132.\\n[s 25.1] \\'Fraudulently\\'; \\'dishonestly\\'.—\\nAccording to the Supreme Court \"the word \"defraud\" includes an element of deceit.\\nDeceit is not an ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word \"dishonestly\" while it is an\\nimportant ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word \"fraudulently\". The former involves a\\npecuniary or economic gain or loss while the latter by construction excludes that\\nelement. Further, the juxtaposition of the two expressions \"dishonestly\" and\\n\"fraudulently\" used in the various sections of the Code indicate their close aﬃnity and\\ntherefore, the deﬁnition of one may give colour to the other. To illustrate, in the\\ndeﬁnition of \"dishonestly\", wrongful gain or wrongful loss is the necessary ingredient.\\nBoth need not exist, one would be enough. So too, if the expression \"fraudulently\" were\\nto be held to involve the element of injury to the person or persons deceived, it would\\nbe reasonable to assume that the injury should be something other than pecuniary or\\neconomic loss. Though almost always an advantage to one causes loss to another and\\nvice versa, it need not necessarily be so.\"133.\\nWhere the accused, after the execution and registration of a document, which was not\\nrequired by law to be attested, added his name to the document as an attesting\\nwitness, it was held that his act was neither fraudulent nor dishonest and the accused\\nwas, therefore, not guilty of forgery.134. A person who is not a member of Scheduled\\nCaste or Scheduled Tribes obtains a false certiﬁcate with a view to gain undue\\nadvantage to which he or she was not otherwise entitled to would amount to\\ncommission of fraud135. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a\\nfraud on the court.136.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

The possession must be conscious and\\nintelligent possession and not merely the physical presence of the accused near the\\nobject.141.\\nCorporeal property is in a person's possession when he has such power over it that he\\ncan exclude others from it, and intends to exercise, if necessary, that power on behalf\\nof himself or of some person for whom he is a trustee.\\nA man's goods are in his possession not only while they are in his house or on his\\npremises, but also when they are in a place where he may usually send them (as when\\nhorses and cattle feed on common land), or in a place where they may be lawfully\\ndeposited by him, e.g., when he buries money or ornaments in his own land, or puts\\nthem in any other secret place of deposit.\\n1.

When a man furnishes a\\nhouse for his mistress' occupation, he may reasonably be presumed to be in\\npossession of all articles therein which can reasonably be inferred to belong to him or\\nto be in possession of his mistress on his behalf. But the inference must be\\ninapplicable to articles of which the mistress is in possession illegally or contrary to the\\nprovisions of law, especially when the article in question is such that he might well\\nremain in ignorance that it was in his mistress' possession.142.\\nUnder this section the possession of the wife or servant must be shown to be on\\naccount of the accused otherwise he cannot be held liable for possession by his wife\\nor servant of any incriminatory thing even in his own house. In other words, it must be\\nshown that the accused was in conscious possession of the thing in question through\\nhis wife or servant. Moreover, it must also be shown that the possession of the\\nincriminatory thing amounted to an offence under the Indian Penal Code.

It also says\\nthat it is not necessary that counterfeit note should be made with primary intention of\\nits being looked as genuine. It is suﬃcient if resemblance to genuine currency note is\\nso caused that it is capable to being passed as such.145.

The difference between the counterfeit and\\nthe original is not therefore, limited to a difference existing only by reason of faulty\\nreproduction.146.

'Acts'.—An 'act' generally means something voluntarily done by a person. 'Act' is a\\ndetermination of the will, producing an effect in the sensible world. This word includes\\nwriting and speaking, or, in short, any external manifestation. In the Code it is not\\nconﬁned to its ordinary meaning of positive conduct of doing something, but includes\\nalso illegal omissions.\\n2. 'Omissions'.—Liability for an omission requires a legal duty to act; a moral duty to act\\nis not suﬃcient. A duty arises from the former when an offence is deﬁned in terms of\\nomission. This is the situation where the legislature has made it an offence. A legal\\nduty to act may also be created by a provision of either criminal or civil separate from\\nthe offence charged. Since there is no moral difference between (i) a positive act and\\n(ii) an omission when a duty is established, it is to be borne in mind that cases of\\nomissions, the liability should be exceptional and needs to be adequately justiﬁed in\\neach instance. Secondly, when it is imposed this should be done by clear statutory\\nlanguage. Verbs primarily denoting (and forbidding) active conduct should not be\\nconstrued to include omissions except when the statute contains a genuine implication\\nto this effect.165.\\nAn 'act' generally means something voluntarily done by a person, but in IPC, 1860 the\\nterm 'act' is not conﬁned to its ordinary meaning of positive conduct of doing\\nsomething but includes also illegal omission. The effect of sections 32 and 33, IPC,\\n1860 taken together is that the term 'act' comprises one or more 'acts' or one or more\\nillegal omissions. The Code (IPC, 1860) makes punishable omissions which have\\ncaused, which have been intended to cause or which have been known to be likely to\\ncause certain evil effect in the same manner as it punishes acts provided they were\\nillegal and when the law imposes on a person a duty to act, his illegal omission to act\\nrenders (him) in liable to punishment.166.\\n[s 32.1] Penalty for omission.—\\nMaximum penalties applied to active wrongdoing should not automatically be\\ntransferred to corresponding omissions; penalties for omissions should be re-thought\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

Criminal liability for an omission is also well accepted where the\\nactor has a legal duty and the capacity to act.

However, section 34 of the IPC, 1860 makes an exception\\nto this principle. It lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act.\\nThe essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention,\\nanimating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. It deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or adverse by several\\npersons, if all are done in furtherance of common intention. In such situation, each\\nperson is liable for the result of that as if he had done that act himself.171. The soul of\\nsection 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172.\\n[s 34.1] History.—\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay.\\nThe original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons,\\neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by\\nhim alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock,\\nCJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the\\nwordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought\\nwhich introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several\\npersons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section\\nhas not been changed or amended ever.\\n[s 34.2] Object.—\\nThe provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be diﬃcult to distinguish\\nbetween acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common\\nintention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true\\ncontents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly,\\nthe position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by\\nhimself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common\\nintention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of\\nthis section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may\\nbe different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common\\nintention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\\nstated the true purport of section 34 as:\\nThe words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited\\nsense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes\\nomission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being\\ndone before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several\\nacts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one\\nof those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the\\nappellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as\\nin other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177.\\n[s 34.3] Principle.—\\nThis section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence.\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of\\nsection 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons\\nparticipating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860\\nstipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In\\nfact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together\\nand on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which\\nof the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction\\nexists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under\\nthat section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply\\neven if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it\\nbecomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended\\nobject.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and\\n307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be\\nconvicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of\\nthe Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally\\ndo a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the\\ncriminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the\\ndoer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to\\nbe partakers with the doer in a different criminal act.\\n[s 34.4] Scope, ambit and applicability.—\\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in\\ncriminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code\\nwould be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the\\ncommission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be\\nnamed and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can\\nbe invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that\\none or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or\\nidentiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the\\nother accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability\\nunder section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable\\nfor the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still\\nbe liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to\\nhim.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as\\nfollows:\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 75}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(a)Criminal act is done by several persons;\\n(b)Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\\n(c)Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\\nby him alone.\\n(d)But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed\\nbefore the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\\nIn other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an\\naccused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts\\nwhich are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the\\nconsequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction\\nof law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise.\\nThe criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons.\\nThe emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not\\nenvisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the\\nultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34\\nshall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre-\\nconcert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a\\nwell settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se\\nsuﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other\\nmembers, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member\\nalso intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187.\\n[s 34.5] Three leading Cases.—\\nThe case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has\\nbeen followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of\\ncases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing\\nwith the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for\\nthe results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a\\ncriminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has\\nregard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of\\nthe series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by\\nmany accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the\\nachievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\\nIn another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\\nSection 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section\\ndoes not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\"\\nUnder the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common\\nintention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act\\ncomplained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the\\ncommon intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any\\none of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the\\nprinciple, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the\\nsection implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the\\nsection it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-\\narranged plan.\\nApproving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra\\nKumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of\\nSupreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the\\napplicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan\\nbecause before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the\\nact must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had\\nin mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention\\n[s 34.6] Common intention and mens rea.—\\nUnder section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which\\nconstitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not\\nonly in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the\\ncommon intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into\\nserious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in\\nwhich others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But\\nreferring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in\\nmind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as\\nunderstood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or\\nidentical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but\\nthey are distinct and different.193.\\n[s 34.7] Participation.—\\nParticipation of several persons in some action with the common intention of\\ncommitting a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established,\\nsection 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the\\nelement of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases\\nbe by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the\\nsection that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the\\ncrime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a\\ngate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a\\ncar on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present\\nat the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the\\noffence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\\nThe Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence\\nmay in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal\\nto the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\\nSometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose\\nas it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman\\'s\\nhusband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening\\nthe door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the\\nwoman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34\\nparticularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a\\nheavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not\\nthat of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the\\noffender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not\\nenough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the\\ncrime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The\\ndegree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two\\ningredients for application of the section which are:\\n(i)', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 77}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='common intention to commit a crime, and\\n(ii)participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common\\nintention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\\nWhere one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to\\nenable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his\\nconduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the\\ncommon intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he\\nwas rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common\\nintention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing\\noutside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the\\nmurder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even\\nact as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no\\nevidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused.\\nNo weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime,\\nconﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co-\\naccused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205.\\n[s 34.8] Physical Presence not sine qua non.—\\nPhysical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the\\naction. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is\\nthe authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of\\nthree Judges stated thus:\\nHe need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate\\noutside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a\\nnearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\\nWhat is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some\\nway or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation\\nneed not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence,\\nnormally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case\\nin respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be\\ndone at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of\\nthe offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions\\nof its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at\\nthe scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the\\nco-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused\\neither by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict\\ninjuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like sub-\\nsections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating\\naccused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine\\nqua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the\\nscene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an\\naccused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the\\nscene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that\\nperson had really done any such act.208.\\nThe absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot\\nbe singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='[s 34.9] In furtherance of common intention.—\\nThe Supreme Court referred to the Oxford English Dictionary where the word\\n\"furtherance\" is deﬁned as an \"action of helping forward.\" Russell, in his book on\\nCriminal Law adopted this deﬁnition and said:\\nIt indicates some kind of aid or assistance proceeding an effect in future and that any act\\nmay be regarded as done in furtherance of the ultimate felony if it is a step intentionally\\ntaken for the purpose of effecting the felony.\" The Supreme Court has also construed the\\nword \"furtherance\" as \"advancement or promotion.210.\\n1. \\'Common intention\\'.—The phrase \\'common intention\\' means a pre-oriented plan and\\nacting in pursuance to the plan. The common intention to give effect to a particular act\\nmay even develop at the spur of moment between a number of persons with reference\\nto the facts of a given case.211. In Amrik Singh\\'s case it has further been held that\\nthough common intention may develop in course of the ﬁght but there must be clear\\nand unimpeachable evidence to justify that inference.212. Before a Court can convict a\\nperson for any offence read with section 34, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion\\nthat the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or\\nunnamed, for committing the said offence.213. Where the act of murder by the main\\naccused was facilitated by two others by catching hold of the victim but without\\nknowing nor having the intention of causing death, it was held that the only common\\nintention that could be inferred was that of causing grievous hurt.214. Where the\\naccused had inﬂicted lathi blows causing injuries only on the eyewitness and not on the\\ndeceased, he could not be said to have shared the common intention of committing\\nmurder of the deceased. He was acquitted for the charge of murder and was convicted\\nunder section 325.215.\\nCommon intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute\\ncommon intention it is necessary that the intention of each one of them be known to\\nthe rest of them and shared by them.216.\\nWhat to speak of similar intention even same intention without sharing each other\\'s\\nintention is not enough for this section.217. In a case like this each will be liable for\\nwhatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of\\nthe others.218. In ﬁne, if common intention cannot be inferred from the evidence of\\nfacts and circumstances of the case, section 34, IPC, 1860, cannot be invoked.219. A\\nparty of farmers was cutting their crop. The deceased took away a portion of the\\nharvested crop. That night when he was returning from a barat 16 persons waited for\\nhim on the way. They came towards him and the convict who was carrying a knife gave\\nhim a stab wound on the neck which proved fatal. The others did not know that he had\\na knife and all of them being with bare hands, it could not be said that they had the\\ncommon intention of causing death. They could as well have thought that after\\nsurrounding the accused he would be called upon to return or pay for the harvest taken\\naway by him.220.A person gifted his land to one of his grandsons. His other son along\\nwith his wife fully armed, the man with a lathi and the woman with a gandasa came to\\nprotest. The man lost control and both grandson and his father intervened to save the\\nsituation but they received lathi blows and died. The woman struck only her brother-in-\\nlaw with the gandasa causing a non-fatal injury. Her husband was convicted for murder\\nbut her punishment was reduced to causing grievous hurt because it appeared that the\\nwhole thing was a spot happening and not a planned affair.221.\\nWhere the genesis of the verbal wrangle between the neighbours was not known, but it\\nappeared to have arisen suddenly, there being no chance for common intention to be\\nformulated, each attacker was held to be punishable for his individual acts.222.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Where common intention was established the mere fact that one of the culprits\\ndistanced himself from the scene could not absolve him from liability.223.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing a case within the scope of section 34 to ﬁnd as to who\\nin fact inﬂicted the fatal blow. A conviction under the section read with the relevant\\nsubstantive provision can be made when the ingredients required by the section are\\nsatisﬁed and it is not necessary to mention the section number in the judgment.224.\\nDeath of two persons was caused by unprovoked ﬁring by appellants who are police\\noﬃcials and grievous gunshot injuries to another person. It was not necessary to\\nassign a speciﬁc role to each individual appellant as the ﬁring at the Car was\\nundoubtedly with a clear intent to annihilate those in it and was resorted to in\\nfurtherance of common intention of all the appellants. The accused were liable to\\nconviction under section 302/34 IPC, 1860.225. The acts of all the accused need not be\\nthe same or identically similar. All that is necessary is that they all must be actuated by\\nthe one and the same common intention. The fact that two of them caused injuries at\\nthe back of their victim and the injury at the head which proved to be fatal was caused\\nby the third person, the two co-accused could not claim to be absolved of liability for\\nmurder.226.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing about the conviction of the co-accused to show that he\\nalso committed an overt act for the achievement of their object. The absence of any\\novert act or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of\\ncommon intention. If common intention by meeting of minds is established in the facts\\nand circumstances of the case there need not be an overt act or possession of weapon\\nrequired, to establish common intention.227.\\nThe accused caught hold of the victim and exhorted the main accused to strike him. On\\nsuch exhortation the main accused inﬂicted a Kirpan wound. The victim died. It was\\nheld that the instigation was only to strike. It could not be said that the accused shared\\nthe intention of the main accused to kill. The conviction was altered from under\\nsections 202/34 to one under section 324.228. The victim woman was murdered by her\\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law. The third person helped them to conceal the dead body\\nto screen them. The conviction of the two accused for murder was upheld but that of\\nthe third one only for concealment of evidence under sections 201/34.229.\\n[s 34.10] Common Intention: How Proved.—\\nThe common intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case and that the\\nintention can be gathered from the circumstances as they arise even during an\\nincident.230. Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's\\nmind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or non-\\nexistence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered\\ncumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each\\ncase. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all\\nrelevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight\\njacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to\\napplication of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisﬁed, the\\nconsequences must follow. It is diﬃcult to state any hard and fast rule which can be\\napplied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of\\nthe given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a\\ncommon intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them\\ntogether.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or\\nconduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an\\ninference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='can arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of\\nassurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other\\nrelevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the\\nmanner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the\\ndetermination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by\\none or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the\\nconcerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of\\nthem left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have\\ndone as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of\\nthe circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion\\nwhether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they\\ncould be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated:\\nWe reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence. The ultimate\\ndecision, at any rate would invariably depend upon the inference deducible from the\\ncircumstances of each case. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of\\nthe individuals concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either\\nfrom direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case\\nand conduct of the parties.237.\\n[s 34.11] Complaint.—\\nIn order to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, the complaint must, prima facie, reﬂect a\\ncommon prior concert or planning amongst all the accused.238.\\n[s 34.12] Effect of no charge under section 34.—\\nEven if section 34 has not been included in a charge framed for the offence under\\nsection 302 IPC, 1860 against the accused, a conviction for the offence under section\\n302 with the aid of section 34 is not bad as no prejudice would be caused to him.239.\\nWhere the appellants caused injuries not enough to cause the death but the same were\\ncaused by another, in the absence of a charge under section 34, they were found to be\\nguilty under section 326 of IPC, 1860.240.\\nSections 34, 114 and 149 of the IPC, 1860 provide for criminal liability viewed from\\ndifferent angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a\\ncommon object or a common intention; and as explained by ﬁve Judge Constitution\\nBench of in Willie Slavey v The State of MP,241. the charge is a rolled-up one involving\\nthe direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable\\nand who are sought to be made constructively liable.242. But before a court can convict\\na person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should\\ncome to a deﬁnite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more\\nother persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations\\nwill bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations.\\n(1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian\\nPenal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that\\nthe said four persons have taken part in the murder.\\n(2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But\\nevidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or\\nunnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to\\nprove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As\\nregards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that\\none of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34,\\nof the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it\\naccepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons,\\nnamed or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In\\nthe second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of\\nthe named accused if it is satisﬁed that no prejudice has been caused to the accused\\nby the defect in the charge. But in the ﬁrst illustration the Court certainly can convict\\ntwo or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly\\nin committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4\\naccused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the\\nbeneﬁt of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as\\nevidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentiﬁed persons\\nacted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it\\nwould be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to\\nthe evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the\\nprosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no\\nbasis in the evidence. There must be some foundation in the evidence that persons\\nother than those named have taken part in the commission of the offence and if there\\nis such a basis the case will be covered by the third illustration.243. Absence of charge\\nunder section 34 is not fatal by itself unless prejudice to the accused is shown.244.\\n[s 34.13] Alternative Charge.—\\nThe trial Court framed charges under sections 302/307 r/w 120B IPC, 1860 and an\\nalternative charge under sections 302/307 r/w section 34 IPC, 1860 without opining on\\nthe alternative charge, convicted the accused under sections 302/307 r/w 120B, The\\ncontention that accused is deemed to be acquitted for charges under sections\\n302/307/34 IPC, 1860 of the charge of common intention of committing murder and\\nthere was no appeal by the State against the deemed acquittal against that charge, it\\nwas not open to the High Court to alter or modify the conviction under sections\\n302/307/34 IPC, 1860, repelled by holding that charges had indeed been framed in the\\nalternative and for cognate offences having similar ingredients as the main allegation\\nof murder.245.\\n[s 34.14] Distinction between sections 34 and 149, IPC, 1860.—\\nThough both these sections relate to the doctrine of vicarious liability and sometimes\\noverlap each other there are substantial points of difference between the two. They are\\nas under:—\\n(i)Section 34 does not by itself create any speciﬁc offence, whereas section 149,\\nIPC, 1860, does so (see discussion under sub-para \"principle\" ante).\\n(ii)Some active participation, especially in a crime involving physical violence is\\nnecessary under section 34 but section 149, IPC, 1860, does not require it and\\nthe liability arises by reason of mere membership of the unlawful assembly with\\na common object and there may be no active participation at all in the\\npreparation and commission of the crime.\\n(iii)Section 34 speaks of common intention but section 149, IPC, 1860,', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='contemplates common object which is undoubtedly wider in its scope and\\namplitude than intention. If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful\\nassembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or\\nsuch as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly\\nwould be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may\\nnot have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that\\noffence.246.\\n(iv)Section 34 does not ﬁx a minimum number of persons who must share the\\ncommon intention, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, requires that there must be\\nat least ﬁve persons who must have the same common object (see also\\ndiscussion under sub-head \"Sections 34 and 149\" under section 149, IPC, 1860,\\ninfra).247.\\n[s 34.15] Effect of conviction or acquittal of one or more or others.—\\nSeveral persons involved in a criminal adventure may be guilty of different offences\\ndepending upon their respective acts. If the act is done in furtherance of their common\\nintention, all of them become equally liable for the act. Similarly, if they are members of\\nan unlawful assembly, an act done by any one in prosecution of the common object or\\nany act which the members knew could happen in such prosecution, every member\\nwould be liable for the act. If any one of them happens to be wrongly acquitted and no\\nappeal has been ﬁled against it, it would not ipso facto impede the conviction of others.\\nLikewise, the conviction of any one or more them does not automatically result in the\\nconviction of others.248.\\n[s 34.16] Substitution of conviction from section 149 to section 34.—\\nFollowing some earlier rulings,249. the Supreme Court has stated the law in the\\nfollowing terms:250.\\nIt is true that there was no charge under s. 302 read with s. 34... but the facts of the case\\nare such that the accused could have been charged alternatively either under s. 302 read\\nwith s. 149 or under s. 302 read with s. 34 and one of the accused having been acquitted,\\nthe conviction under s. 302/149 can be substituted with one under s. 302/34. No prejudice\\nis likely to be caused to the accused whose appeal is being dismissed.251.\\n[s 34.17] Robbery.—\\nProvision under section 397 inevitably negates the use of the principles of constructive\\nor vicarious liability engrafted under section 34. The sentence for offence under section\\n397 of the IPC, 1860 cannot be awarded to those of the members of the group of\\ndacoits who did not use any deadly weapon. A plain reading of section 397 of the IPC,\\n1860 would make it clear that such guilt can be attributed only to that offender who\\nuses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person during course of the\\ncommission of the robbery. The provision postulates that only the individual act of\\naccused will be relevant to attract section 397 of the IPC, 1860.252. In a sudden quarrel\\nover payment, person sitting inside the car pulled the petrol pump attendant into the\\ncar and drove away. The occupants of the car escaped punishment. It was held that the\\ndriver alone could not be held guilty of the offence of robbery and abduction with the\\naid of section 34.253.

Both of them were\\nheld to be guilty of successive crimes and convicted for murder with the aid of section\\n34 without any need of knowing who played what part.254.\\n[s 34.18] Mob action.—\\nA mob of 200 persons armed with different weapons came to the ﬁeld with the object\\nof preventing the prosecution party from carrying on transplantation operations. Some\\nof them caused death of a person at the spur of the moment for some spot reason.\\nThe whole mob could not be convicted for it.255 A mob chased the members of the\\nrival community up to their locality. A part of the mob started burning their houses and\\nthe other part kept on chasing and caused deaths. The court said that the two parts of\\nthe mob could not be said to have shared the intention of burning or causing death.256.\\n[s 34.19] Misappropriation.—\\nWhere the accused the Sarpanch and Secretary of a Gram Panchayat misappropriated\\nthe funds of the Panchayat and the circumstances and evidence showed patent\\ndishonest intention on the part of the accused persons, the conviction and sentence of\\nthe accused under section 409/34, was not interfered with.257.\\n[s 34.20] Rape cases.—\\nIn Gang Rape it is not necessary that the intention should exists from the beginning. It\\ncan be developed at the last minute before the commission of the offence.258.\\n[s 34.21] Exhortation.—\\nOne of the accused exhorted while the other immobilised the deceased and the third\\naccused delivered the fatal injuries. It was held that each one shared a common\\nintention.259. Section 34 was held to have been rightly applied where two of the\\naccused persons caught hold of the deceased and on their exhortation the third\\naccused shot him on the right temple resulting in death.260.\\nMere exhortation by one of the accused persons saying that they would not leave the\\nvictim till he died was held to be not a basis for roping into the common intention of the\\nothers.261.

In such a situation,\\nwhere the eye witnesses have not narrated any speciﬁc role carried by the appellant,\\nrather the speciﬁc role of assaulting with the sword has been attributed to the co-\\naccused, it cannot be ruled out that the name of the appellant has been added due to\\nenmity with the main accused.262.\\n[s 34.22] Pre-conceived common intention.—', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n",

Section 96 IPC, 1860 says that nothing is an offence\\nwhich is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. Though all the accused\\nwould be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in\\nfurtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they\\nhad the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common\\nintention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private\\ndefence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to\\nbe one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private\\ndefence.\\nIf the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence\\nunder section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result\\nthat the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under\\nthe relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common\\nintention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the conﬁnes of s. 96\\nread with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been\\naccrued to the accused. If the right of private defence was exceeded by some persons,\\nthe guilt of each of the accused proved to have exceeded the right of private defence\\nwould have to be dealt with separately. The instant case came under the former\\nsituation, and hence, such persons were guilty under section 304, Part I IPC, 1860.\\nThey, therefore, must be held to have had a common object for causing death of P.\\nThey were sentenced to undergo ten years' rigorous imprisonment each.264.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\nCHAPTER II GENERAL EXPLANATIONS\\nTHIS Chapter is for the most part an elaborate interpretation clause. It is a key to the\\ninterpretation of the whole Code. The leading terms used are here deﬁned and\\nexplained and the meanings thus, announced are steadily adhered to throughout the\\nsubsequent chapters.\\n170.[[s 34] Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.\\nWhen a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common\\nintention 1 of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it\\nwere done by him alone.]\\nCOMMENT—\\nIntroduction.—Ordinarily, no man can be held responsible for an independent act and\\nwrong committed by another. However, section 34 of the IPC, 1860 makes an exception\\nto this principle. It lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act.\\nThe essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention,\\nanimating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. It deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or adverse by several\\npersons, if all are done in furtherance of common intention. In such situation, each\\nperson is liable for the result of that as if he had done that act himself.171. The soul of\\nsection 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172.\\n[s 34.1] History.—\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay.\\nThe original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons,\\neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by\\nhim alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock,\\nCJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the\\nwordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought\\nwhich introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several\\npersons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section\\nhas not been changed or amended ever.\\n[s 34.2] Object.—\\nThe provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be diﬃcult to distinguish\\nbetween acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common\\nintention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true\\ncontents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly,\\nthe position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by\\nhimself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common\\nintention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of\\nthis section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\\ncommission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may\\nbe different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"intention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\\nstated the true purport of section 34 as:\\nThe words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited\\nsense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes\\nomission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being\\ndone before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several\\nacts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one\\nof those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the\\nappellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as\\nin other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177.\\n[s 34.3] Principle.—\\nThis section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence.\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of\\nsection 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons\\nparticipating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860\\nstipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In\\nfact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together\\nand on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which\\nof the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction\\nexists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under\\nthat section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply\\neven if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it\\nbecomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended\\nobject.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and\\n307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be\\nconvicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of\\nthe Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally\\ndo a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the\\ncriminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the\\ndoer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to\\nbe partakers with the doer in a different criminal act.\\n[s 34.4] Scope, ambit and applicability.—\\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in\\ncriminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code\\nwould be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the\\ncommission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be\\nnamed and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can\\nbe invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that\\none or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or\\nidentiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the\\nother accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability\\nunder section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable\\nfor the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still\\nbe liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to\\nhim.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as\\nfollows:\\n(a)Criminal act is done by several persons;\\n(b)Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\\n(c)Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\\nby him alone.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 93}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(d)But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed\\nbefore the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\\nIn other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an\\naccused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts\\nwhich are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the\\nconsequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction\\nof law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise.\\nThe criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons.\\nThe emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not\\nenvisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the\\nultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34\\nshall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre-\\nconcert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a\\nwell settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se\\nsuﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other\\nmembers, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member\\nalso intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187.\\n[s 34.5] Three leading Cases.—\\nThe case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has\\nbeen followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of\\ncases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing\\nwith the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for\\nthe results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a\\ncriminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has\\nregard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of\\nthe series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by\\nmany accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the\\nachievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\\nIn another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\\nSection 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section\\ndoes not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\"\\nUnder the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common\\nintention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act\\ncomplained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the\\ncommon intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any\\none of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the\\nprinciple, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the\\nsection implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the\\nsection it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-\\narranged plan.\\nApproving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra\\nKumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of\\nSupreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the\\napplicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to\\nestablish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan\\nbecause before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the\\nact must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had\\nin mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention\\n[s 34.6] Common intention and mens rea.—', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 94}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Under section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which\\nconstitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not\\nonly in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the\\ncommon intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into\\nserious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in\\nwhich others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But\\nreferring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in\\nmind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as\\nunderstood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or\\nidentical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but\\nthey are distinct and different.193.\\n[s 34.7] Participation.—\\nParticipation of several persons in some action with the common intention of\\ncommitting a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established,\\nsection 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the\\nelement of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases\\nbe by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the\\nsection that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the\\ncrime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a\\ngate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a\\ncar on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present\\nat the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the\\noffence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\\nThe Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence\\nmay in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal\\nto the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\\nSometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose\\nas it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman\\'s\\nhusband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening\\nthe door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the\\nwoman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34\\nparticularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a\\nheavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not\\nthat of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the\\noffender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not\\nenough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the\\ncrime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The\\ndegree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two\\ningredients for application of the section which are:\\n(i)common intention to commit a crime, and\\n(ii)participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common\\nintention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\\nWhere one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to\\nenable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his\\nconduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the\\ncommon intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he\\nwas rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common\\nintention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing\\noutside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 95}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='murder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even\\nact as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no\\nevidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused.\\nNo weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime,\\nconﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co-\\naccused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205.\\n[s 34.8] Physical Presence not sine qua non.—\\nPhysical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the\\naction. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is\\nthe authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of\\nthree Judges stated thus:\\nHe need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate\\noutside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a\\nnearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\\nWhat is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some\\nway or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation\\nneed not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence,\\nnormally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case\\nin respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be\\ndone at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of\\nthe offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions\\nof its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at\\nthe scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the\\nco-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused\\neither by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict\\ninjuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like sub-\\nsections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating\\naccused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine\\nqua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the\\nscene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an\\naccused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the\\nscene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that\\nperson had really done any such act.208.\\nThe absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot\\nbe singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209.\\n[s 34.9] In furtherance of common intention.—\\nThe Supreme Court referred to the Oxford English Dictionary where the word\\n\"furtherance\" is deﬁned as an \"action of helping forward.\" Russell, in his book on\\nCriminal Law adopted this deﬁnition and said:\\nIt indicates some kind of aid or assistance proceeding an effect in future and that any act\\nmay be regarded as done in furtherance of the ultimate felony if it is a step intentionally\\ntaken for the purpose of effecting the felony.\" The Supreme Court has also construed the\\nword \"furtherance\" as \"advancement or promotion.210.\\n1. \\'Common intention\\'.—The phrase \\'common intention\\' means a pre-oriented plan and\\nacting in pursuance to the plan. The common intention to give effect to a particular act\\nmay even develop at the spur of moment between a number of persons with reference\\nto the facts of a given case.211. In Amrik Singh\\'s case it has further been held that\\nthough common intention may develop in course of the ﬁght but there must be clear\\nand unimpeachable evidence to justify that inference.212. Before a Court can convict a\\nperson for any offence read with section 34, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 96}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"that the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or\\nunnamed, for committing the said offence.213. Where the act of murder by the main\\naccused was facilitated by two others by catching hold of the victim but without\\nknowing nor having the intention of causing death, it was held that the only common\\nintention that could be inferred was that of causing grievous hurt.214. Where the\\naccused had inﬂicted lathi blows causing injuries only on the eyewitness and not on the\\ndeceased, he could not be said to have shared the common intention of committing\\nmurder of the deceased. He was acquitted for the charge of murder and was convicted\\nunder section 325.215.\\nCommon intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute\\ncommon intention it is necessary that the intention of each one of them be known to\\nthe rest of them and shared by them.216.\\nWhat to speak of similar intention even same intention without sharing each other's\\nintention is not enough for this section.217. In a case like this each will be liable for\\nwhatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of\\nthe others.218. In ﬁne, if common intention cannot be inferred from the evidence of\\nfacts and circumstances of the case, section 34, IPC, 1860, cannot be invoked.219. A\\nparty of farmers was cutting their crop. The deceased took away a portion of the\\nharvested crop. That night when he was returning from a barat 16 persons waited for\\nhim on the way. They came towards him and the convict who was carrying a knife gave\\nhim a stab wound on the neck which proved fatal. The others did not know that he had\\na knife and all of them being with bare hands, it could not be said that they had the\\ncommon intention of causing death. They could as well have thought that after\\nsurrounding the accused he would be called upon to return or pay for the harvest taken\\naway by him.220.A person gifted his land to one of his grandsons. His other son along\\nwith his wife fully armed, the man with a lathi and the woman with a gandasa came to\\nprotest. The man lost control and both grandson and his father intervened to save the\\nsituation but they received lathi blows and died. The woman struck only her brother-in-\\nlaw with the gandasa causing a non-fatal injury. Her husband was convicted for murder\\nbut her punishment was reduced to causing grievous hurt because it appeared that the\\nwhole thing was a spot happening and not a planned affair.221.\\nWhere the genesis of the verbal wrangle between the neighbours was not known, but it\\nappeared to have arisen suddenly, there being no chance for common intention to be\\nformulated, each attacker was held to be punishable for his individual acts.222.\\nWhere common intention was established the mere fact that one of the culprits\\ndistanced himself from the scene could not absolve him from liability.223.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing a case within the scope of section 34 to ﬁnd as to who\\nin fact inﬂicted the fatal blow. A conviction under the section read with the relevant\\nsubstantive provision can be made when the ingredients required by the section are\\nsatisﬁed and it is not necessary to mention the section number in the judgment.224.\\nDeath of two persons was caused by unprovoked ﬁring by appellants who are police\\noﬃcials and grievous gunshot injuries to another person. It was not necessary to\\nassign a speciﬁc role to each individual appellant as the ﬁring at the Car was\\nundoubtedly with a clear intent to annihilate those in it and was resorted to in\\nfurtherance of common intention of all the appellants. The accused were liable to\\nconviction under section 302/34 IPC, 1860.225. The acts of all the accused need not be\\nthe same or identically similar.

       " Document(page_content=\"by the third person, the two co-accused could not claim to be absolved of liability for\\nmurder.226.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing about the conviction of the co-accused to show that he\\nalso committed an overt act for the achievement of their object. The absence of any\\novert act or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of\\ncommon intention. If common intention by meeting of minds is established in the facts\\nand circumstances of the case there need not be an overt act or possession of weapon\\nrequired, to establish common intention.227.\\nThe accused caught hold of the victim and exhorted the main accused to strike him. On\\nsuch exhortation the main accused inﬂicted a Kirpan wound. The victim died. It was\\nheld that the instigation was only to strike. It could not be said that the accused shared\\nthe intention of the main accused to kill. The conviction was altered from under\\nsections 202/34 to one under section 324.228. The victim woman was murdered by her\\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law. The third person helped them to conceal the dead body\\nto screen them. The conviction of the two accused for murder was upheld but that of\\nthe third one only for concealment of evidence under sections 201/34.229.\\n[s 34.10] Common Intention: How Proved.—\\nThe common intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case and that the\\nintention can be gathered from the circumstances as they arise even during an\\nincident.230. Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's\\nmind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or non-\\nexistence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered\\ncumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each\\ncase. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all\\nrelevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight\\njacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to\\napplication of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisﬁed, the\\nconsequences must follow. It is diﬃcult to state any hard and fast rule which can be\\napplied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of\\nthe given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a\\ncommon intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them\\ntogether.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or\\nconduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an\\ninference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability\\ncan arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of\\nassurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other\\nrelevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the\\nmanner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the\\ndetermination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by\\none or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the\\nconcerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of\\nthem left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have\\ndone as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of\\nthe circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion\\nwhether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they\\ncould be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated:\\nWe reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence.

But before a court can convict\\na person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should\\ncome to a deﬁnite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more\\nother persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations\\nwill bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations.\\n(1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian\\nPenal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that\\nthe said four persons have taken part in the murder.\\n(2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But\\nevidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or\\nunnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence.\\n(3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to\\nprove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As\\nregards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that\\none of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34,\\nof the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it\\naccepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons,\\nnamed or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In\\nthe second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of\\nthe named accused if it is satisﬁed that no prejudice has been caused to the accused\\nby the defect in the charge. But in the ﬁrst illustration the Court certainly can convict\\ntwo or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly\\nin committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4\\naccused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the\\nbeneﬁt of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as\\nevidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentiﬁed persons\\nacted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it\\nwould be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to\\nthe evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the\\nprosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no\\nbasis in the evidence.

Absence of charge\\nunder section 34 is not fatal by itself unless prejudice to the accused is shown.244.\\n[s 34.13] Alternative Charge.—\\nThe trial Court framed charges under sections 302/307 r/w 120B IPC, 1860 and an\\nalternative charge under sections 302/307 r/w section 34 IPC, 1860 without opining on\\nthe alternative charge, convicted the accused under sections 302/307 r/w 120B, The\\ncontention that accused is deemed to be acquitted for charges under sections\\n302/307/34 IPC, 1860 of the charge of common intention of committing murder and\\nthere was no appeal by the State against the deemed acquittal against that charge, it\\nwas not open to the High Court to alter or modify the conviction under sections\\n302/307/34 IPC, 1860, repelled by holding that charges had indeed been framed in the\\nalternative and for cognate offences having similar ingredients as the main allegation\\nof murder.245.\\n[s 34.14] Distinction between sections 34 and 149, IPC, 1860.—\\nThough both these sections relate to the doctrine of vicarious liability and sometimes\\noverlap each other there are substantial points of difference between the two. They are\\nas under:—\\n(i)Section 34 does not by itself create any speciﬁc offence, whereas section 149,\\nIPC, 1860, does so (see discussion under sub-para \"principle\" ante).\\n(ii)Some active participation, especially in a crime involving physical violence is\\nnecessary under section 34 but section 149, IPC, 1860, does not require it and\\nthe liability arises by reason of mere membership of the unlawful assembly with\\na common object and there may be no active participation at all in the\\npreparation and commission of the crime.\\n(iii)Section 34 speaks of common intention but section 149, IPC, 1860,\\ncontemplates common object which is undoubtedly wider in its scope and\\namplitude than intention. If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful\\nassembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or\\nsuch as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly\\nwould be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may\\nnot have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that\\noffence.246.\\n(iv)Section 34 does not ﬁx a minimum number of persons who must share the\\ncommon intention, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, requires that there must be\\nat least ﬁve persons who must have the same common object (see also\\ndiscussion under sub-head \"Sections 34 and 149\" under section 149, IPC, 1860,\\ninfra).247.\\n[s 34.15] Effect of conviction or acquittal of one or more or others.—\\nSeveral persons involved in a criminal adventure may be guilty of different offences\\ndepending upon their respective acts. If the act is done in furtherance of their common\\nintention, all of them become equally liable for the act. Similarly, if they are members of\\nan unlawful assembly, an act done by any one in prosecution of the common object or\\nany act which the members knew could happen in such prosecution, every member\\nwould be liable for the act. If any one of them happens to be wrongly acquitted and no\\nappeal has been ﬁled against it, it would not ipso facto impede the conviction of others.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

No prejudice\\nis likely to be caused to the accused whose appeal is being dismissed.251.\\n[s 34.17] Robbery.—\\nProvision under section 397 inevitably negates the use of the principles of constructive\\nor vicarious liability engrafted under section 34. The sentence for offence under section\\n397 of the IPC, 1860 cannot be awarded to those of the members of the group of\\ndacoits who did not use any deadly weapon. A plain reading of section 397 of the IPC,\\n1860 would make it clear that such guilt can be attributed only to that offender who\\nuses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person during course of the\\ncommission of the robbery. The provision postulates that only the individual act of\\naccused will be relevant to attract section 397 of the IPC, 1860.252. In a sudden quarrel\\nover payment, person sitting inside the car pulled the petrol pump attendant into the\\ncar and drove away. The occupants of the car escaped punishment. It was held that the\\ndriver alone could not be held guilty of the offence of robbery and abduction with the\\naid of section 34.253. In a serial highway robbery and murder in which same persons\\nwere involved, it was found as a fact that the self-same two persons were seen by a\\nwitness together in a different town before the occurrence. One of their victims\\nsurvived and he also testiﬁed that he saw both of them together. Both of them were\\nheld to be guilty of successive crimes and convicted for murder with the aid of section\\n34 without any need of knowing who played what part.254.\\n[s 34.18] Mob action.—\\nA mob of 200 persons armed with different weapons came to the ﬁeld with the object\\nof preventing the prosecution party from carrying on transplantation operations.

It was held that each one shared a common\\nintention.259. Section 34 was held to have been rightly applied where two of the\\naccused persons caught hold of the deceased and on their exhortation the third\\naccused shot him on the right temple resulting in death.260.\\nMere exhortation by one of the accused persons saying that they would not leave the\\nvictim till he died was held to be not a basis for roping into the common intention of the\\nothers.261. The only allegation against the appellant was her exhortation. Enmity\\nbetween the family of the deceased and that of the accused proved. In such a situation,\\nwhere the eye witnesses have not narrated any speciﬁc role carried by the appellant,\\nrather the speciﬁc role of assaulting with the sword has been attributed to the co-\\naccused, it cannot be ruled out that the name of the appellant has been added due to\\nenmity with the main accused.262.\\n[s 34.22] Pre-conceived common intention.—\\nOnly when a court with some certainty holds that a particular accused must have pre-\\nconceived or pre-meditated the result which ensued or acted in concert with others in\\norder to bring about that result, that section 34 may be applied.263.\\n[s 34.23] Common intention and private defence.—\\nIf two or more persons had common intention to commit murder and they had\\nparticipated in the acts done by them in furtherance of that common intention, all of\\nthem would be guilty of murder. Section 96 IPC, 1860 says that nothing is an offence\\nwhich is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. Though all the accused\\nwould be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in\\nfurtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they\\nhad the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common\\nintention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private\\ndefence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to\\nbe one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private\\ndefence.\\nIf the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence\\nunder section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result\\nthat the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under\\nthe relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common\\nintention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the conﬁnes of s. 96\\nread with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been\\naccrued to the accused. If the right of private defence was exceeded by some persons,\\nthe guilt of each of the accused proved to have exceeded the right of private defence\\nwould have to be dealt with separately. The instant case came under the former\\nsituation, and hence, such persons were guilty under section 304, Part I IPC, 1860.\\nThey, therefore, must be held to have had a common object for causing death of P.\\nThey were sentenced to undergo ten years' rigorous imprisonment each.264.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 102}),\n",

Under this section several\\npersons who actually perform the act must be shown to have the particular intent or\\nknowledge, if the act is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal\\nknowledge or intention. If several persons, having one and the same criminal intention\\nor knowledge, jointly commit murder or an assault, each is liable for the offence as if he\\nhas acted alone; but if several persons join in an act, each having a different intention\\nor knowledge from the others, each is liable according to his own criminal intention or\\nknowledge, and he is not liable further. If an act which is an offence in itself and\\nwithout reference to any criminal knowledge or intention on the part of the doers is\\ndone by several persons, each of such persons is liable for the offence.\\nNeither section 34 nor this section provides that those who take part in the act are\\njointly liable for the same offence. They merely provide that each of the performers\\nshall be liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. In\\nthis section also, the responsibility is shared by each offender individually if the act\\nwhich is criminal only by reason of certain criminal knowledge or intention is done by\\neach person sharing that knowledge or intention.265. A mere look at that section shows\\nthat if the act alleged against these accused becomes criminal on account of their\\nsharing common knowledge about the defective running of Plant at Bhopal by the\\nremaining accused who represented them on the spot and who had to carry out their\\ndirections from them and who were otherwise required to supervise their activity.\\nSection 35 of the Indian Penal Code could at least prima facie be invoked against\\naccused 2, 3, 4 and 12 to be read with section 304-A Indian Penal Code.266.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 109}),\n",

A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with\\nintent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects of the several doses of poison so\\nadministered to him. Here A and B intentionally co-operate in the commission of\\nmurder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are\\nboth guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.\\n(b)A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner,\\nalternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death,\\nknowingly co-operate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the\\ntime of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose,\\nZ dies of hunger.

A is dismissed\\nfrom his oﬃce, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A,\\nillegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause\\nZ's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate\\nwith B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThis section follows as a corollary from section 35 as appears from the illustrations. It\\nprovides that, when several acts are done so as to result together in the commission of\\nan offence, the doing of any one of them, with an intention to co-operate in the offence\\n(which may not be the same as an intention common to all), makes the actor liable to\\nbe punished for the commission of the offence.268. By co-operating in the doing of\\nseveral acts which together constitute a single criminal act, each person who co-\\noperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of the acts is either singly\\nor jointly liable for that offence.269. If common intention is the hub of section 34,\\nintentional cooperation is the spindle of section 37 of the Penal Code.

Therefore, going by the main clause\\nof section 40, the word \"offence\" since denotes the thing made punishable under the\\nCode, \\'other offence\\' mentioned in section 141 \\'third\\', can only denote to offences,\\nwhich are punishable under any of the provisions of the Code. Therefore, by applying\\nthe main clause of section 40, it can be straight away held that all offences referred to\\nin any of the provisions of the Code for which the punishment is provided for would\\nautomatically fall within the expression \"other offence\", which has been used in section\\n141 \\'third\\'. Therefore, a conspectus reading of section 40 makes the position\\nabundantly clear that for all offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the main\\nclause of section 40 would straight away apply in which event the expression \"other\\noffence\" used in section 141 \\'third\\', will have to be construed as any offence for which\\npunishment is prescribed under the Code. To put it differently, whosoever is proceeded\\nagainst for any offence punishable under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code,\\nsection 40 sub-clause 1 would straight away apply for the purpose of construing what\\nthe offence is and when it comes to the question of offence under any other special or\\nlocal law, the aid of sub-clause 2 and 3 will have to be applied for the purpose of\\nconstruing the offence for which the accused is proceeded against. Therefore, having\\nregard to sub-clause 1 of section 40 of the Code read along with section 141 \\'third\\', the\\nargument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants will have to be rejected. Only\\nsuch a construction would be in tune with the purport and intent of the law makers\\nwhile deﬁning an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence with a common\\nobject, as speciﬁed under section 141 of the Code.302.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

Section 2(n) of Cr PC, 1973 deﬁnes\\noffence as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force\\nand includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be under section 20 of the\\nCattle Trespass Act 1871 (1 of 1871). Thus, the deﬁnition of \\'offence\\' under section\\n2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences\\nunder other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence\\nseldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a\\nrule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a\\nbasic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions\\nwhich have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in\\nnature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and\\nomissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned\\nstatute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the\\nstatutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become\\nliable to be punished.

In the absence of a\\ndeﬁnition in a special act, the term \\'offence\\' should be understood in the context of\\nsection 40 of the Indian Penal Code as an act that is criminally punishable and section\\n3(38) of the General Clauses Act as an act made punishable by any law and the\\nessential ingredient is that it should be a criminal act as understood.290. In Naz\\nFoundation v NCT Delhi.291. section 377 of IPC, 1860 in so far it criminalised\\nconsensual sexual acts of adults in private, was held violative of Article 21, Article 14\\nand Article 15 of the Constitution by the Delhi High Court.292. This judgement of the\\nDelhi High Court was later overruled by the Supreme Court on 12 December 2013 in\\nSuresh Kumar Koushal case.293. Finally in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,294. a ﬁve-judge\\nbench of the Supreme Court declared section 377 of the Indian Penal Code\\nunconstitutional, insofar as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults of same\\nsex in private. However, other parts of Section 377 relating to sex with minors and\\nbestiality remain in force.\\n[s 40.1] Offences under Special law.—\\nA plain reading of this provision of law makes it crystal clear that the effect of clause\\n(2) of section 40 is to make everything punishable under the special law as an offence\\nwithin the meaning of the Indian Penal Code. The offences under the NDPS Act thus,\\nbecome offences under the Indian Penal Code as the term \"offence\" in certain cases is\\nextended to the things made punishable under any special or local law.295.\\n[s 40.2] Article 20(1).—\\nThe word \\'offence\\' under Article 20 sub-clause (1) of the Constitution has not been\\ndeﬁned under the Constitution. But Article 367 of the Constitution states that unless\\nthe context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act 1897 shall apply for the\\ninterpretation of the Constitution as it does for the interpretation of an Act.296.\\n[s 40.3] Offence and breach of duty distinguished.—\\nOffence generally implies infringement of public, as distinguished from mere private\\nrights punishable under criminal law. When trial for criminal offence is conducted it\\nshould be in accordance with proof of the offence as per the evidence deﬁned under\\nthe provisions of the Evidence Act. Converse is the case of departmental enquiry. The\\nenquiry in departmental proceedings relates to conduct or breach of duty of the\\ndelinquent oﬃcer to punish him for his misconduct deﬁned under the relevant statutory\\nrules or law.297.\\n[s 40.4] Suicide.—\\nSuicide by itself is not an offence under either English or Indian Criminal Law, though at\\none time it was a felony in England.298.\\n[s 40.5] Euthanasia.—\\nIn India active euthanasia is illegal and a crime under section 302 or at least section\\n304 IPC, 1860. Physician assisted suicide is a crime under section 306 IPC, 1860\\n(abetment to suicide).299. But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,300. the Supreme\\nCourt held that passive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances\\nunder the strict monitoring of the Court.

Naz Foundation v NCT Delhi, 2010 Cr LJ 94 (Del).Section 40 speciﬁcally mentions as to how the term \\'offence\\' will have to be construed.\\nIn the main clause of the said section it has been clearly set out that the word \"offence\"\\ndenotes a thing made punishable by this Code except the chapters and sections\\nmentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of the said section. Therefore, going by the main clause\\nof section 40, the word \"offence\" since denotes the thing made punishable under the\\nCode, \\'other offence\\' mentioned in section 141 \\'third\\', can only denote to offences,\\nwhich are punishable under any of the provisions of the Code. Therefore, by applying\\nthe main clause of section 40, it can be straight away held that all offences referred to\\nin any of the provisions of the Code for which the punishment is provided for would\\nautomatically fall within the expression \"other offence\", which has been used in section\\n141 \\'third\\'. Therefore, a conspectus reading of section 40 makes the position\\nabundantly clear that for all offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the main\\nclause of section 40 would straight away apply in which event the expression \"other\\noffence\" used in section 141 \\'third\\', will have to be construed as any offence for which\\npunishment is prescribed under the Code. To put it differently, whosoever is proceeded\\nagainst for any offence punishable under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code,\\nsection 40 sub-clause 1 would straight away apply for the purpose of construing what\\nthe offence is and when it comes to the question of offence under any other special or\\nlocal law, the aid of sub-clause 2 and 3 will have to be applied for the purpose of\\nconstruing the offence for which the accused is proceeded against. Therefore, having\\nregard to sub-clause 1 of section 40 of the Code read along with section 141 \\'third\\', the\\nargument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants will have to be rejected. Only\\nsuch a construction would be in tune with the purport and intent of the law makers\\nwhile deﬁning an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence with a common\\nobject, as speciﬁed under section 141 of the Code.302.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 123}),\n",

It may,\\nhowever, be argued that nothing could be more harmful to the mind of a woman than\\nthe death of her husband, and the section speaks of harm to the mind as \\'injury\\'. The\\nformer Chief Court of the Punjab held that loss of her husband\\'s support affected a\\nwidow prejudicially in a legal right, and was therefore, an injury as deﬁned in the Penal\\nCode.316.

Its\\nimport is totally different from saying that the person concerned has honestly believed\\nthe truth of what is said. See the language of the law in this regard. It starts in the\\nnegative tone excluding all except what is allowed to be within its amplitude. Insistence\\nsought to be achieved through the commencing words of the deﬁnition \"nothing is said\\nto be done or believed in good faith\" is that the solitary item included within the purview\\nof the expression \"good faith\" is what is done with \"due care and attention\". Due care\\ndenotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. In Black\\'s\\nLaw Dictionary, \"reasonable care\" is explained as \"such a degree of care, precaution, or\\ndiligence as may fairly and properly be expected or required, having regard to the\\nnature of the action, or of the subject matter and the circumstances surrounding the\\ntransaction. It is such care as an ordinary prudent person would exercise under the\\nconditions existing at the time he is called upon to act\".331. The element of honesty\\nwhich is introduced by the deﬁnition prescribed by the General Clauses Act is not\\nintroduced by the deﬁnition of the Penal Code; and we are governed by the deﬁnition\\nprescribed by section 52 of that Code.332. Nothing is an offence which is done by any\\nperson who is justiﬁed by law, or who by reason of mistake of fact and not by reason of\\nmistake of law, in good faith, believes himself to be justiﬁed by law, in doing it.333.\\nSome parents made poisonous propaganda against an educational institution.

So also the accused\\nare not entitled to exception 9 of section 499, IPC, 1860 merely on the reason that the\\npublications were not made in good faith.335.\\nGood faith is a question of fact to be considered and decided on the facts of each\\ncase. Section 52 of the Penal Code emphasizes due care and attention in relation to\\nthe good faith. In the General Clauses Act emphasis is laid on honesty.336. The\\nmeaning of the expression \"good faith\" is what is done with \"due care and attention\".\\nDue care denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised.

If he does not do so he cannot claim that what he did\\nwas bona ﬁde i.e. done in good faith. Thus, a contemner, if he is to establish \"good\\nfaith\" has to say that he conducted a reasonable and proper enquiry before making an\\nimputation.337.

[Secondly.—Imprisonment for life;]\\n2. [***]\\nFourthly.—Imprisonment, which is of two descriptions, namely:—\\n(1) Rigorous, that is, with hard labour;\\n(2) Simple;\\nFifthly.—Forfeiture of property;\\nSixthly.—Fine.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe object of punishment in the scheme of modern social defence is correction of the\\nwrongdoer and not wrecking gratuitous punitive vengeance on the criminal. Some\\nattempts have been made to modernise our penal system through piecemeal\\nlegislation at best for the ﬁrst offenders, the children and the juvenile delinquents\\nexample the Probation of Offenders Act 1958, the Juvenile Justice (Care and\\nProtection of Children) Act 2000, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act,\\n2015 etc. In the Indian Penal Code, there is no scope for individualising the punishment;\\nrather these ﬁve forms of punishment have to be doled out to the offenders irrespective\\nof their psycho-social problems and needs of individual offenders. Commenting on this\\nunhappy aspect of our penal system Krishna iyer, J, observed in Shivaji\\'s case\\'.3.\\nTwo men in their twenties thus stand convicted of murder and have to suffer imprisonment\\nfor life because the punitive strategy of our Penal Code does not suﬃciently reﬂect the\\nmodern trends in correctional treatment and personalised sentencing. When accused\\npersons are of tender age then even in a murder case it is not desirable to send them\\nbeyond the high prison walls and forget all about their correction and eventual reformation.\\nIn Inder Singh\\'s case4. the Supreme Court issued directions to the State Government to\\nsee that the young accused of the case are not given any degrading work and they are\\ngiven the beneﬁt of liberal parole every year if their behaviour shows responsibility and\\ntrustworthiness. Moreover, the Sessions Judge was directed to make jail visits to\\nensure compliance with these directions.\\n[s 53.1] Object of Punishment.—\\nOne of the prime objectives of criminal law is imposition of appropriate, adequate, just\\nand proportionate sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of crime and', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 143}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"the manner in which the crime is done.5. Undue sympathy by means of imposing\\ninadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system and undermine the\\npublic conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of law.6. The object should be to protect the society\\nand to deter the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate\\nsentence. It is expected that the Courts would operate the sentencing system so as to\\nimpose such sentence which reﬂects the conscience of the society and the sentencing\\nprocess has to be stern where it should be.7. The main purpose of the sentence broadly\\nstated is that the accused must realise that he has committed an act which is not only\\nharmful to the society of which he forms an integral part but is also harmful to his own\\nfuture, both as an individual and as a member of the society. Punishment is designed\\nto protect society by deterring potential offenders as also by preventing the guilty party\\nfrom repeating the offence; it is also designed to reform the offender and re-claim him\\nas a law-abiding citizen for the good of the society as a whole. Reformatory, deterrent\\nand punitive aspects of punishment thus play their due part in judicial thinking while\\ndetermining this question. In modern civilized societies, however, reformatory aspect is\\nbeing given somewhat greater importance. Too lenient as well as too harsh sentences\\nboth lose their eﬃcaciousness. One does not deter and the other may frustrate thereby\\nmaking the offender a hardened criminal.8.\\n[s 53.2] Different Approaches.—\\nPunishment in criminal cases is both punitive and reformative. The purpose is that the\\nperson found guilty of committing the offence is made to realise his fault and is\\ndeterred from repeating such acts in future. On the commission of crime, three types of\\nreactions may generate; the traditional reaction of universal nature which is termed as\\npunitive approach. It regards the criminal as a notoriously dangerous person who must\\nbe inﬂicted severe punishment to protect the society from his criminal assaults. The\\nother approach is the therapeutic approach. It regards the criminal as a sick person\\nrequiring treatment, while the third is the preventive approach, which seeks to eliminate\\nthose conditions from the society, which were responsible for crime causation. Under\\nthe punitive approach, the rationalisation of punishment is based on retributive and\\nutilitarian theories. Deterrent theory, which is also part of the punitive approach,\\nproceeds on the basis that the punishment should act as a deterrent not only to the\\noffender, but also to others in the community. The therapeutic approach aims at curing\\nthe criminal tendencies, which were the product of a diseased psychology. Therapeutic\\napproach has since been treated as an effective method of punishment, which not only\\nsatisﬁes the requirements of law that a criminal should be punished and the\\npunishment prescribed must be meted out to him, but also reforms the criminal\\nthrough various processes, the most fundamental of which is that in spite of having\\ncommitted a crime, may be a heinous crime, he should be treated as a human being\\nentitled to all the basic human rights, human dignity and human sympathy. It was under\\nthis theory that this Court in a stream of decisions, projected the need for prison\\nreforms, the need to acknowledge the vital fact that the prisoner, after being lodged in\\njail, does not lose his fundamental rights or basic human rights and that he must be\\ntreated with compassion and sympathy.9. Imposing a hard punishment on the accused\\nserves a limited purpose, but at the same time, it is to be kept in mind that relevance of\\ndeterrent punishment in matters of serious crimes affecting society should not be\\nundermined. Within the parameters of the law an attempt has to be made to afford an\\nopportunity to the individual to reform himself and lead life of a normal, useful member\\nof society and make his contribution in that regard.10. In Dhannajoy Chatterjee v State of\\nWB,11. the Supreme Court has observed that shockingly large number of criminals go\\nunpunished, thereby increasingly encouraging the criminals and ultimately making\\njustice suffer by weakening the system's credibility. Realising that it is not the brutality\\nof punishment but its surety that serves as a greater deterrent, our Supreme Court held\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='that a barbaric crime does not have to be visited with a barbaric penalty such as public\\nhanging which will be clearly violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.12. With regards\\nthe question of punishment, it should be noted that punishment in one matter cannot\\nbe the guiding factor for punishment in another. Punishment has a co-relation with\\nfacts and in each case where punishment is imposed, the same must be the resultant\\neffect of the acts complained of. More serious the violation, more severe is the\\npunishment and that has been the accepted norm, in matters though, however, within\\nthe prescribed limits.13.\\n[s 53.3] Reformation Theory.—\\nThe reformative aspect is meant to enable the person concerned to relent and repent\\nfor his action and make himself acceptable to the society as a useful social being.14.\\nTheory of reformation through punishment is grounded on the sublime philosophy that\\nevery man is born good but circumstances transform him into a criminal. The aphorism\\nthat \"if every saint has a past every sinner has a future\" is a tested philosophy\\nconcerning human life. VR Krishna Iyer, J, has taken pains to ornately fresco the\\nreformative proﬁle of the principles of sentencing in Mohammad Giasuddin v State of\\nAP.15. Reformation should hence be the dominant objective of a punishment and\\nduring incarceration, every effort should be made to recreate the good man out of\\nconvicted prisoner. An assurance to him that his hard labour would eventually snowball\\ninto a handsome saving for his own rehabilitation would help him to get stripped of the\\nmoroseness and desperation in his mind while toiling with the rigours of hard labour\\nduring the period of his jail life. Thus, reformation and rehabilitation of a prisoner are of\\ngreat public policy. Hence, they serve a public purpose.16. Punishment is also to reform\\nsuch wrongdoers not to commit such offence in future.17.\\n[s 53.4] Deterrence.—\\nDeterrence is one of the vital considerations of punishment. Law demands that the\\noffender should be adequately punished for the crime, so that it can deter the offender\\nand other persons from committing similar offences. Nature and circumstances of the\\noffence; the need for the sentence imposed to reﬂect the seriousness of the offence; to\\nafford adequate deterrence to the conduct and to protect the public from such crimes\\nare certain factors to be considered while imposing the sentence.18. Any liberal attitude\\nby imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of\\nlapse of time or personal inconveniences in respect of such offences will be result-wise\\ncounterproductive in the long run and against societal interest which needs to be cared\\nfor and strengthened by string of deterrence built in the sentencing system.19. For\\ninstance, a murder committed due to deep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not\\ncall for penalty of death. However, an organised crime or mass murders of innocent\\npeople would call for imposition of death sentence as deterrence.20. Protection of\\nsociety and deterring the criminal is the avowed object of law and is required to be\\nachieved by imposing an appropriate sentence. The sentencing Courts are expected to\\nconsider all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and\\nproceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence. Courts\\nmust hear the loud cry for justice by the society in cases of heinous crimes like rape on\\ninnocent helpless girls of tender years, as in this case, and respond by imposition of\\nproper sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reﬂection through imposition of\\nappropriate sentence by the Court. To show mercy in the case of such a heinous crime\\nwould be a travesty of justice.21. To give a lesser punishment to the appellants would\\nbe to render the justice system of this country suspect.

Punishment to an accused in criminal\\njurisprudence is not merely to punish the wrongdoer but also to strike warning to those\\nwho are in the same sphere of crime or to those intending to join in such crime.23.\\n[s 53.5] Principles of sentencing.—\\nSentencing is an important task in the matters of crime. There is no straitjacket\\nformula for sentencing an accused on proof of crime. In practice, there is much\\nvariance in the matter of sentencing. In many countries, there are laws prescribing\\nsentencing guidelines, but there is no statutory sentencing policy in India.24. The Indian\\nPenal Code provides discretion to Indian Judges while awarding the sentence.25.\\nCourts have wide discretion in awarding sentence within the statutory limits.26. The\\nCourts have evolved certain principles: twin objective of the sentencing policy is\\ndeterrence and correction.27. There are many philosophies behind sentencing justifying\\npenal consequences. The philosophical/jurisprudential justiﬁcation can be retribution,\\nincapacitation, speciﬁc deterrence, general deterrence, rehabilitation, or restoration.\\nAnyone or a combination thereof can be the goal of sentencing. However, when it\\ncomes to sentencing a person for committing a heinous crime, the deterrence theory\\nas a rationale for punishing the offender becomes more relevant. In such cases, the\\nrole of mercy, forgiveness and compassion becomes secondary and while determining\\nthe quantum of sentence, discretion lies with the Court. While exercising such a\\ndiscretion, the Court has to govern itself by reason and fair play, and discretion is not to\\nbe exercised according to whim and caprice. It is the duty of the Court to impose\\nadequate sentence, for one of the purposes of imposition of requisite sentence is\\nprotection of the society and a legitimate response to the collective conscience. While\\nconsidering as to what would be the appropriate quantum of imprisonment, the Court\\nis empowered to take into consideration mitigating circumstances, as well as\\naggravating circumstances.28. What sentence would meet the ends of justice depends\\non the facts and circumstances of each case and the Court must keep in mind the\\ngravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant\\ncircumstances.29. The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality\\nin prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct. It\\nordinarily allows some signiﬁcant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a sentence in\\neach case, presumably to permit sentences that reﬂect more subtle considerations of\\nculpability that are raised by the special facts of each case. Judges in essence aﬃrm\\nthat punishment ought always to ﬁt the crime; yet in practice, sentences are\\ndetermined largely by other considerations. Sometimes it is the correctional needs of\\nthe perpetrator that are offered to justify a sentence, sometimes the desirability of\\nkeeping him out of circulation, and sometimes even the tragic results of his crime.\\nInevitably, these considerations cause a departure from just desert as the basis of\\npunishment and create cases of apparent injustice that are serious and widespread.30.\\nProportion between crime and punishment is a goal respected in principle, and in spite\\nof errant notions, it remains a strong inﬂuence in the determination of sentences. The\\npractice of punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is now unknown in civilized\\nsocieties, but such a radical departure from the principle of proportionality has\\ndisappeared from the law only in recent times. Even now for a single grave infraction,\\ndrastic sentences are imposed. Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for\\nany serious crime is thought then to be a measure of toleration that is unwarranted and\\nunwise. But in fact, quite apart from those considerations that make punishment\\nunjustiﬁable when it is out of proportion to the crime, uniformly disproportionate\\npunishment has some very undesirable practical consequences.31. The principle of\\nproportionality in sentencing a crime doer is well entrenched in criminal jurisprudence.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 146}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"As a matter of law, proportion between crime and punishment bears most relevant\\ninﬂuence in determination of sentencing the crime doer. The Court has to take into\\nconsideration all aspects including social interest and consciousness of the society for\\naward of appropriate sentence.32. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence\\nwould do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public conﬁdence in the\\neﬃcacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats.\\nImposition of sentence without considering its effect on the social order in many cases\\nmay be in reality a futile exercise. The social impact of the crime e.g. where it relates to\\noffences against women, dacoity, kidnapping, misappropriation of public money,\\ntreason and other offences involving moral turpitude or moral delinquency which have\\ngreat impact on social order and public interest, cannot be lost sight of and per se\\nrequire exemplary treatment. Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or\\ntaking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time in respect of such\\noffences will be result wise counterproductive in the long run and against societal\\ninterest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by a string of deterrence inbuilt\\nin the sentencing system.33. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do\\nmore harm to the justice system to undermine the public conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of\\nlaw and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is, therefore, the\\nduty of every Court to award proper sentence keeping in mind the nature of the offence\\nand the manner in which it was executed or committed etc. Thus, it is evident that\\nCriminal Law requires strict adherence to the rule of proportionality in providing\\npunishment according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct keeping in\\nmind the effect of not awarding just punishment on the society.34. An undeserved\\nindulgence or liberal attitude in not awarding adequate sentence in such cases would\\namount to allowing or even to encouraging 'potential criminals'. The society can no\\nlonger endure under such serious threats. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by\\nsociety in cases of heinous crime of rape and impose adequate sentence. Public\\nabhorrence of the crime needs reﬂection through imposition of appropriate sentence\\nby the Court.35.\\n[s 53.6] Factors to be considered.—\\nThese are some factors which are required to be taken into consideration before\\nawarding appropriate sentence to the accused. These factors are only illustrative in\\ncharacter and not exhaustive. Each case has to be seen from its special perspective.\\nThe relevant factors are as under:\\n(a) Motive or previous enmity;\\n(b) Whether the incident had taken place on the spur of the moment;\\n(c) The intention/knowledge of the accused while inﬂicting the blow or injury;\\n(d) Whether the death ensued instantaneously or the victim died after several days;\\n(e) The gravity, dimension and nature of injury;\\n(f) The age and general health condition of the accused;\\n(g) Whether the injury was caused without pre-meditation in a sudden ﬁght;\\n(h) The nature and size of weapon used for inﬂicting the injury and the force with which\\nthe blow was inﬂicted;\\n(i) The criminal background and adverse history of the accused;\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(j) Whether the injury inﬂicted was not suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death but the death was because of shock;\\n(k) Number of other criminal cases pending against the accused;\\n(l) Incident occurred within the family members or close relations;\\n(m) The conduct and behaviour of the accused after the incident. Whether the accused\\nhad taken the injured/the deceased to the hospital immediately to ensure that he/she\\ngets proper medical treatment?\\nThese are some of the factors which can be taken into consideration while granting an\\nappropriate sentence to the accused.\\nThe list of circumstances enumerated above is only illustrative and not exhaustive. In\\nour considered view, proper and appropriate sentence to the accused is the bounded\\nobligation and duty of the Court. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the\\naccused receives appropriate sentence, in other words, sentence should be according\\nto the gravity of the offence. These are some of the relevant factors which are required\\nto be kept in view while convicting and sentencing the accused.36. The facts and given\\ncircumstances in each case, the nature of the crime, the manner in which it was\\nplanned and committed, the motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the\\naccused, the nature of weapons used and all other attending circumstances are\\nrelevant facts which would enter into the area of consideration.37.\\n[s 53.7] Judicial Discretion:38. Cases.—\\nA Judge has wide discretion in awarding the sentence within the statutory limits. Since\\nin many offences, only the maximum punishment is prescribed and for some offences\\nthe minimum punishment is prescribed, each Judge exercises his discretion\\naccordingly.39. In case where for an offence, maximum imprisonment is prescribed and\\nthere is no provision for minimum imprisonment, the Court can exercise wide\\ndiscretion imposing any imprisonment which may be from one day (or even till the\\nrising of the court) to ten years/life.40. However, the Courts will have to take into\\naccount certain principles while exercising their discretion in sentencing, such as\\nproportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is\\nnecessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the\\ncommensurate punishment for the offender.41. Though punishment is the discretion of\\nthe Court, yet it must be exercised judicially and where circumstances call for a\\ndeterrent punishment, it ought to be awarded in an appropriate case.42. Thus where the\\naccused, a young man of 22 committed multiple murders for sheer gain in a most\\ncruel, callous and ﬁendish fashion, there was no way to show him any mercy as it was\\nrarest of the rare cases where a sentence of death was fully justiﬁed.43. In exercising\\nthis discretion, the Court must consider the gravity of the offence, the mitigating or the\\nextenuating circumstances of the case which may justify the award of the lesser or\\nmaximum sentence.44. Where the accused was a youth of 19, the Supreme Court while\\nupholding conviction under section 304-Part I, Indian Penal Code, 1860, (IPC, 1860)\\nreduced his sentence to the period already undergone which was 18 and a half months\\nin the instant case. The accused, a Government servant, who will lose pensionary\\nbeneﬁts due to conviction, deserves to be treated leniently.\\nThe Supreme Court has laid down that in cases of death in custody on account of third\\ndegree methods, deterrent punishment should be awarded.45.

       " Document(page_content='died, were convicted under section 342, it was held that the facts that one of the\\naccused was recipient of a medal from the President for saving a life, was awarded Rs.\\n5,000 by the State Government also and was suffering from T.B. and the other accused\\nhad acted on the direction of his superior, were not mitigating circumstances and the\\naccused were liable to be punished with the maximum sentence.46.\\nWhere due to dire poverty the accused killed his ailing wife, as he could not provide\\nmoney for her operation and thereafter killed his two children, as they would be\\nneglected after their mother\\'s death, it was held the accused deserved to be awarded\\nlife imprisonment and not capital punishment.47. Where the murder in question showed\\nsigns of ruthless, unrelenting and determined vindictiveness and though the accused\\nwas 55 at the time of occurrence and 70 at the time of this appeal, the Supreme Court\\ndid not think it necessary to modify his sentence of life imprisonment.48. Similarly,\\nwhere murders were committed for gain, the Supreme Court refused to interfere with\\ndeath sentence only because the condemned prisoners were very young and their\\nwives and children and aged parents were dependent on them. Such considerations,\\nthe Court said, are present in most cases.49. Where, for the offence of dacoity under\\nsection 395, the trial Court awarded three years\\' R.I., the High Court acquitted the\\noffenders, but the Supreme Court restored the conviction after a long gap during which\\nthey got married and had resumed normal life, the period already undergone was\\nconsidered to be suﬃcient, but a ﬁne of Rs. 3,000 was imposed on each of them.50.\\nWhere a conviction under section 16I, IPC, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the\\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 was conﬁrmed, the Gujarat High Court modiﬁed the\\nsentence of R.I. for one year and ordered that the appellant shall undergo sentence of\\nR.I. for six months only. This was done in view of his age of 60 years and a number of\\nillnesses he was suffering from.51. The accused had been out of job for nearly 16 years\\nand had undergone the trial for a number of years. He was 65 years old but had\\nreceived no pension and had a large family to maintain. Hence, the Supreme Court\\nwhile conﬁrming the conviction, reduced the sentence of one year R.I. each under\\nsection 161 and the Prevention of Corruption Act to 15 days R.I. on each count. The\\nsentence of ﬁne was however conﬁrmed.52. Where the accused had accepted a very\\nsmall amount of Rs. 30 as bribe about 16 years back and underwent the agony of trial\\nfor a long time and had to support his family, he had been in jail for some time during\\ntrial, considering these facts his sentence of imprisonment was reduced from three\\nmonths R.I. to the period already undergone.53.\\nImposition of proper and appropriate sentence is bounded obligation and duty of the\\nCourt. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the accused received\\nappropriate sentence. The sentence must be accorded to the gravity of the offence.54.\\n[s 53.8] Minimum Sentence.—\\nIn order to exercise the discretion of reducing the sentence the statutory requirement is\\nthat the Court has to record \"adequate and special reasons\" in the judgment and not\\nfanciful reasons, which would permit the Court to impose a sentence less than the\\nprescribed minimum. The reason has not only to be adequate but also special. What is\\nadequate and special would depend upon several factors and no straitjacket formula\\ncan be indicated.55. Mere absence of provisions for minimum sentence is no reason or\\njustiﬁcation to treat the offence under the Act (NDPS) as any less serious.56.\\nFor the offence of murder, minimum sentence is \\'life imprisonment\\'. Thus, the High\\nCourt cannot modify the sentence of life imprisonment awarded by the Trial Court to\\nthe one already undergone.57.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 149}),\n",

Where a person was married in childhood and was\\nsubjected to a second marriage under the pressure exerted by his parents as well as\\nthe woman who became his second wife, it was held that a lesser sentence of six\\nmonths instead two years' R.I. and a ﬁne of Rs. 2,000 to the accused husband and\\nimprisonment till the rising of the Court and a ﬁne of Rs. 1,500 to the accused parents\\nand the second wife in place of the original sentence of six months' R.I. and a ﬁne of\\nRs. 1,000 would meet the ends of justice.85.\\n[s 53.14] Conversion of death sentence into life imprisonment.—\\nWhere the accused, being dissatisﬁed with the partition of family property, committed\\nghastly murders of four members of his family and there was no evidence that the\\ncrime was pre-planned and the circumstances indicated that he was under the\\ninﬂuence of some kind of extreme mental or emotional disturbance which impaired his\\ncapacity to appreciate criminality of his conduct, death sentence awarded to him was\\nconverted into imprisonment for life.86. Where three accused persons conspired to kill\\nthe wife and two minor children of one of the accused but one of the accused was not\\na party to actual commission of murder and the part played by the other accused was\\nnot deﬁnitely proved, the sentence of death imposed on both the accused was\\ncommuted to that of life imprisonment. The death sentence of the main accused, the\\nfather, was not interfered with.87. Where the accused shot his two younger brothers\\ndead on a petty quarrel, as there was no pre-plan to commit murder, the death sentence\\nawarded to the accused was altered into life imprisonment with a ﬁne of Rs. 30,000.88.\\n[s 53.15] Award of compensation.—\\nPower of Courts to award compensation is not ancillary to other sentences but it is in\\naddition thereto. This power was intended to do something to reassure the victim that\\nhe or she is not forgotten in the criminal justice system. It is a measure of responding\\nappropriately to crime as well of reconciling the victim with the offender. It is, to some\\nextent, a constructive approach to crimes. It is indeed a step forward in our criminal\\njustice system.89. The purpose of imposition of ﬁne and/or grant of compensation to a\\ngreat extent must be considered having the relevant factors therefore in mind. It may\\nbe compensating the person in one way or the other.90.\\nIn the BMW Case, the Supreme Court directed the accused to pay an amount of Rs. 50\\nlakh to the Union of India which will be utilized within for providing compensation to the\\nvictims of motor accidents, where the vehicles owner, driver etc. could not be traced,\\nlike victims of hit and run cases.91. Where a doctor was convicted for an attempt to\\ncause miscarriage and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and\\npay a ﬁne of Rs. 5,000, the sentence of imprisonment was found to be excessive and\\nwas set aside but the ﬁne was enhanced to Rs. 15,000 out of which, if realised Rs.\\n10,000 was to be paid to the mother of the deceased for the maintenance of the\\nchildren of the deceased shown to be living with her.92.

Out of the ﬁne, if paid, Rs. 10,000\\nwere to be given to the mother of the deceased and Rs. 30,000 utilised for the beneﬁt\\nof the three minor children of the deceased in sum of Rs. 10,000 each.93. Where the\\naccused caused a serious injury in the abdomen of a man and was convicted under\\nsection 307 but considering that he had a widowed mother and two children and was\\nwilling to compensate the victim substantially, sentence imposed upon him was\\nmodiﬁed into one of ﬁne in the way of compensation of Rs. One lakh.94. Where in a\\ncase under section 304, Part II the accused remained in custody for over a year after\\nconviction by the High Court and also for sometime during investigation, the Apex\\nCourt reduced the sentence to the period already undergone but imposed a ﬁne of Rs.\\n20,000 payable to the widow of the deceased as compensation.95.\\n[s 53.16] Reform and rehabilitation.—\\nWhere the accused caused several incised injuries to a man, he was convicted under\\nsection 326 but as there was no previous enmity between the accused and the injured\\nperson and it was the ﬁrst offence committed by him, besides 14 years had lapsed\\nsince the commission of the offence, he was given an opportunity to reform and\\nrehabilitate in society and his sentence was reduced to the period already\\nundergone.96. Where the accused convicted under section 302 was only 15 years old at\\nthe time of offence and at the time of appeal he was over 30, he could not be sent to\\napproved school or jail. His conviction was upheld but the sentence was quashed.97.\\n[s 53.17] Separate trial for child offender.—\\nOne of the members of an unlawful assembly was of 13 years at the time of the\\nincident. His trial was conducted along with other members who were not children.\\nThis was held to be illegal. The plea of child offender was not raised before the trial\\ncourt or the High Court. The Supreme Court, therefore, conﬁrmed the conviction but set\\naside the sentence imposed on him.98.\\n[s 53.18] Cases of no leniency.—\\nIn a multiple murder case, it was argued that the accused had donated to the social\\norganisations and that he was not a hardened criminal and not a menace to the society\\nand at any rate by wiping him out the crime cannot be wiped out. The Supreme Court\\nobserved that the accused was involved in \"organised criminal activity\" and he had\\nacquired social status through crime. The accused had no regard for the value of\\nhuman life. It was held that there were no mitigating circumstances. The main cause of\\nhis conviction was illicit arrack business and brothel. The fact that for this reason he\\nbecame the victim of police cruelty was also considered to be not a mitigating\\ncircumstance.99. In a double murder case, the accused was awarded death sentence\\nbut the execution was postponed. It was held that pain, agony and horror suffered by\\nthe prisoner after he was informed about execution was no ground for substituting\\ndeath sentence.100.

       " Document(page_content=\"was held that the sentence could not be reduced merely because the matter was more\\nthan seven years old and that it would also be a grave injustice to the victims of the\\ncrime.101. Where the accused formed an unlawful assembly with the common object of\\nkilling three members of a family and one of the accused killed all the three on the spot\\none after the other in few minutes while others caught hold of the victims, the sentence\\nof life imprisonment awarded to them under sections 302/149 was conﬁrmed but the\\nHigh Court observed that it was a ﬁt case to award the maximum penalty of death\\nsentence as the accused had acted like a butcher in a slaughter house.102. Where the\\naccused were convicted under section 328 r/w. section 34 for robbing a simple\\ninnocent lady of 50 years by administering a stupefying drug through sugarcane juice,\\nthe Court refused to take a lenient view and reduce the sentence.103. Where the\\naccused committed a high-handed and broad daylight robbery on a public road, the\\nCourt declined to take a lenient view.104. Voluntary intoxication by itself neither\\nabsolves the offender of the consequences of his act nor does it makes him liable for\\nlesser offence.105. The mere fact that the accused inﬂicted a single injury resulting in\\ndeath is not suﬃcient in itself to convert the offence from one under sections 300–304,\\nPart II.106. When the victim has sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the\\nbody and the injury is life-threatening imposition of sentence of six days only which\\nwas the period already undergone by the accused in conﬁnement is too lenient.\\nHowever, as the parties have forgotten their differences and are living peacefully since\\n25 years, the Court taking into consideration the aggravating as well as mitigating\\nfactors under the facts of this case, imposed a sentence of six months' R.I. and a ﬁne\\nof Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.107.\\n[s 53.19] No leniency—Offences against women.—\\nWhere the accused committed rape on a woman and killed her and it was found that he\\nhad behaved like an animal, it was held that it was not a ﬁt case for showing\\nleniency.108. Where in a case of bride burning, the mother-in-law of the victim was\\nsentenced to life imprisonment, the Supreme Court refused to show any leniency on\\nthe ground that the accused mother-in-law had remained in jail for more than a decade.\\nThe Court observed that it would be a travesty of justice if sympathy was shown when\\na cruel act like bride burning is committed. It is rather strange that the mother-in-law\\nwho herself is a woman should resort to killing another woman. Undue sympathy\\nwould be harmful to the cause of justice.109. Where the accused himself killed his wife\\nby burning and made his two children motherless, no lenient view could be taken on the\\nground that he had two children.110.\\n[s 53.20] Enhancement of sentence.—\\nWhere in a group clash due to old enmity, the accused killed ten persons of a\\ncommunity indiscriminately within a span of two hours and accused took the leading\\npart, sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon him was enhanced to death penalty\\nin the facts and circumstances of the case but life imprisonment awarded to the co-\\naccused under sections 302/149 was conﬁrmed.111.\\n[s 53.21] Guidelines for sentencing policy.—\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 158}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Currently, India does not have a structured sentencing guidelines that have been issued\\neither by the legislature or the judiciary. However, the Courts have framed certain\\nguidelines in the matter of imposition of sentence. The Courts will have to take into\\naccount certain principles while exercising their wide discretion in sentencing, such as\\nproportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is\\nnecessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the\\ncommensurate punishment for the offender.112. Justice demands that Courts should\\nimpose punishment beﬁtting the crime so that the Courts reﬂect public abhorrence of\\nthe crime.113. Law regulates social interests, arbitrates conﬂicting claims and demand.\\nUndoubtedly, there is a cross-cultural conﬂict where living law must ﬁnd answer to the\\nnew challenges and the Courts are required to mould the sentencing system to meet\\nthe challenges.114.\\nThe principle governing the imposition of punishment will depend upon the facts and\\ncircumstances of each case. However, the sentence should be appropriate, adequate,\\njust, proportionate and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the crime and the\\nmanner in which the crime is committed. The gravity of the crime, motive for the crime,\\nnature of the crime and all other attending circumstances have to be borne in mind\\nwhile imposing the sentence.115. An offence, which affects the morale of the society,\\nshould be severely dealt with. Socio-economic status, religion, race, caste or creed of\\nthe accused and the victim although may not be wholly irrelevant, should be eschewed\\nin a case of this nature (abduction and rape of minor), particularly when Parliament\\nitself has laid down minimum sentence.\\nOne of the principles that the judiciary had all along kept in its mind that rape being a\\nviolation with violence of the private person of a woman causes mental scar, thus, not\\nonly a physical injury but also a deep sense of some deathless shame is also\\ninﬂicted.116.\\nThe Court cannot afford to be casual while imposing the sentence, inasmuch as both\\nthe crime and the criminal are equally important in the sentencing process. The Courts\\nmust see that the public does not lose conﬁdence in the judicial system. Imposing\\ninadequate sentences will do more harm to the justice system and may lead to a state\\nwhere the victim loses conﬁdence in the judicial system and resorts to private\\nvengeance.117.\\n6.

Graver the crime greater the sentence.\\nBut, serving the society actually is not a punishment in the real sense where the\\nconvicts pay back to the community which he owes. Conduct of the convicts will not\\nonly be appreciated by the community, it will also give a lot of solace to him, especially\\nin a case where because of one\\'s action and inaction, human lives have been lost. In\\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, where six human lives were lost, Court felt to\\nadopt this method would be good for the society rather than incarcerating the convict\\nfurther in jail.

It is the result of the recognition\\nof the doctrine that the object of the criminal law is more to reform the individual\\noffender than to punish him. Broadly stated that the PO Act distinguishes offenders\\nbelow 21 years of age and those above that age, and offenders who are not guilty of\\nhaving committed an offence punishable with death or that imprisonment for life and\\nthose who are guilty of a lesser offence. While in the case of offenders who are above\\nthe age of 21 years absolute discretion is given to the Court to release them after\\nadmonition or on probation of good conduct, subject to the conditions laid down in the\\nappropriate provisions of the PO Act. In case of offender below the age of 21 years, an\\ninjunction is issued to the Court not to sentence them to imprisonment unless it is\\nsatisﬁed that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of\\nthe offence and the character of the offenders, it is not desirable to deal with them\\nunder sections 3 and 4 of the PO Act.122. The PO Act introduced a very basic change in\\nthe criminal law of the country. At the same time, Courts were also to be careful about\\nthe impact on the society consequent on letting offenders on probation. Indiscriminate\\napplication of provisions of the PO Act to anti-social and white collar offenders may\\nhave an adverse effect on the security of the society. Application of the PO Act is\\nspeciﬁcally barred in some cases.123. Provisions of the PO Act should be applied\\nhaving regard to the nature of offence and age, character and antecedents of the\\noffender.124.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 160}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\nCHAPTER III OF PUNISHMENTS\\n[s 54] Commutation of sentence of death.\\nIn every case in which sentence of death shall have been passed, 127.[the appropriate\\nGovernment] may, without the consent of the offender, commute the punishment for\\nany other punishment provided by this Code.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe law governing suspension, remission and commutation of sentence is both\\nstatutory and constitutional.128. The stage for the exercise of this power generally\\nspeaking is post-judicial, i.e., after the judicial process has come to an end. After the\\njudicial function ends, the executive function of giving effect to the judicial verdict\\ncommences. Constitutional power under Article 72/161 would override the statutory\\npower contained in sections 432 and 433 and the limitation of section 433A of the\\nCode as well as the power conferred by sections 54 and 55, IPC, 1860.129. No convict\\nhas a fundamental right of remission or shortening of sentence. The State in exercise\\nof its executive power of remission must consider each individual case keeping in view\\nthe relevant factors. The power of the State to issue general instructions, so that no\\ndiscrimination is made, is also permissible in law.130. Exercise of executive clemency is\\na matter of discretion and yet subject to certain standards. It is not a matter of\\nprivilege.131. A right to be considered for remission, keeping in view the constitutional\\nsafeguards of a convict under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India, must be\\nheld to be a legal one. Such a legal right emanates from not only the Prisons Act but\\nalso from the Rules framed thereunder.132. The power of remission vested in the\\nGovernment under section 433A Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) is not\\nin conﬂict with Articles 72 and 162 of the Constitution.133. Granting of pardon is in no\\nsense an overturning of a judgment of conviction, but rather it is an executive action\\nthat mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime. It eliminates the effect of\\nconviction without addressing the defendant's guilt or innocence.134. It is open to the\\nPresident in the exercise of the power vested in him by Article 72 of the Constitution to\\nscrutinize the evidence on the record of the criminal case and come to a different\\nconclusion from that recorded by the Court in regard to the guilt of, and sentence\\nimposed on, the accused.135.\\n[s 54.1] Delay in Execution whether entitle commutation of Death sentence to\\nLife Imprisonment.—\\nIn TV Vatheeswaran's case, AIR 1983 SC 361 [LNIND 1983 SC 43] : 1983 SCR (2) 348136.\\na two-Judge Bench of SC considered whether the accused, who was convicted for an\\noffence of murder and sentenced to death, kept in solitary conﬁnement for about eight\\nyears was entitled to commutation of death sentence. It was held that delay exceeding\\ntwo years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to\\nentitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the\\nquashing of the sentence of death.137.

       " Document(page_content='unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence\\nshould be allowed to be commuted, no hard and fast rule that \"delay exceeding two\\nyears in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to entitle\\nthe person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of\\nthe sentence of death\" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran Javed\\nAhmed v State of Maharashtra,139. re-iterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran\\n(supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-Judge Bench to overrule the\\nVatheeswaran Case. The conﬂicting views are ﬁnally settled by the Constitution Bench\\nin Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat.140. It overruled Vatheeswaran (supra) holding that\\nundue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned\\nperson to approach this Court under Article 32 but the Court will only examine the\\nnature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence was ﬁnally\\nconﬁrmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the\\nconclusions reached by the Court while ﬁnally maintaining the sentence of death.\\nCourt, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all\\ncircumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be\\ncarried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No ﬁxed period of delay\\ncould be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the\\ndecision in Vatheeswaran case cannot be said to lay down the correct law. In Madhu\\nMehta v UOI,141.,142. Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that\\nthe mercy petition was pending for eight years after disposal of the criminal appeal by\\nSupreme Court.\\n[s 54.1.1] Devender Singh Bhullar and Mahendra Das.—\\nIn Devender Pal Singh Bhullar v State of NCT of Delhi,143. the convict appealed to the\\nPresident for clemency in 2003. The President, after a lapse of over eight years,\\ndismissed his mercy plea in 2011. Bhullar had sought commutation of his death\\npenalty to life sentence by the Supreme Court on the ground that there was inordinate\\ndelay by the President over his plea for clemency. A two-Judge Bench144. by order\\ndated 12 April 2013 dismissed his plea, by holding that the rule enunciated in Sher\\nSingh\\'s case (supra), Triveniben\\'s case (supra) and some other judgments that long\\ndelay may be one of the grounds for commutation of the sentence of death into life\\nimprisonment cannot be invoked in cases where a person is convicted for offence\\nunder TADA or similar statutes. Two weeks later in Mahendra Nath Das v UOI,145. the\\nsame Bench held that the convict\\'s death sentence could be commuted to life\\nimprisonment because much of the inordinate delay of 12 years in the rejection of his\\nmercy petition by the President was unexplained, and therefore, inexcusable.\\n[s 54.2] Modiﬁcation of death sentence to a particular period with the further\\ndirection that the convict must not be released from prison for the rest of his\\nlife or before actually serving out the term.—\\nIt was in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v State of Karnataka,146. the three-Judge Bench held\\nthat there is a good and strong basis for the Court to substitute a death sentence by life\\nimprisonment or by a term in excess of 14 years and further to direct that the convict\\nmust not be released from the prison for the rest of his life or for the actual term as\\nspeciﬁed in the order, as the case may be. But a two-Judge Bench in Sangeet v State of\\nHaryana147. in which it was held that:\\na reading of some recent decisions delivered by this Court seems to suggest that the\\nremission power of the appropriate Government has effectively been nulliﬁed by awarding\\nsentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some cases without any remission.

The words in italics werein Swamy Shraddananda and several other cases, by giving a sentence in a capital offence\\nof 20 years or 30 years imprisonment without remission, is to effectively injunct the\\nappropriate Government from exercising its power of remission for the speciﬁed period. In\\nour opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion, but as at present advised, we\\nare of the opinion that this is not permissible.

It is now\\nconclusively settled by a catena of decisions that the punishment of imprisonment for\\nlife handed down by the Court means a sentence of imprisonment for the convict for\\nthe rest of his life.167. However, Supreme Court has been, for quite some time,\\nconscious of the liberal approach and sometimes discriminatory too, taken by the\\nStates in exercise of their power under sections 432 and 433 of Cr PC, 1973 in\\nremitting or commuting sentences. In Jagmohan Singh v State of UP,168. Court had\\nexpressed concern about such approach made by the States in remitting life sentences\\nthat led to the amendment in Cr PC introducing section 433A by Act 45 of 1978. Under\\nsection 433A of Cr PC, 1973 a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed for an\\noffence for which death is one of the punishments or where a death sentence is\\ncommuted to life under section 433, he shall not be released unless he has served 14\\nyears of imprisonment.\\nIt appears that the provision has been generally understood to mean that life sentence\\nwould only be 14 years of incarceration. Taking judicial notice of such a trend, the\\nSupreme Court has, in cases where imposition of death sentence would be too harsh\\nand imprisonment for life (the way it is understood as above) too inadequate, in several\\ncases, has adopted different methods to ensure that the minimum term of life\\nimprisonment ranges from at least 20 years to the end of natural life. However, in some\\ncases, the Court had also been voicing concern about the statutory basis of such\\norders.169. In the case of State of Rajasthan v Jamil Khan,170. the Supreme Court opined\\nthat:\\nWe are of the view that it will do well in case a proper amendment under section 53 of IPC is\\nprovided, introducing one more category of punishment - life imprisonment without\\ncommutation or remission. Dr. VS Malimath, J, in the Report on 'Committee of Reforms of\\nCriminal Justice System', submitted in 2003, had made such a suggestion but so far no\\nserious steps have been taken in that regard. There could be a provision for imprisonment\\ntill death without remission or commutation.\\n[s 55.1] The power of High Court to commute.—\\nExercise of power under section 433 is an executive discretion. The High Court in\\nexercise of its revisional jurisdiction had no power conferred on it to commute the\\nsentence imposed where a minimum sentence was provided for offence.

In the absence of an order the section is not applicable because there can be no order bythe sentence of a convict and to prematurely order his release before expiry of the\\nsentence as imposed by the Courts.171. In State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v Prem Raj,172.\\nSupreme Court was called upon to consider whether in a case involving conviction\\nunder section 7 read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, the\\nHigh Court could commute the sentence of imprisonment on deposit of a speciﬁed\\namount by the convict and direct the State Government to pass appropriate order under\\nsection 433(c) Cr PC, 1973. It was held that the question of remission lay within the\\ndomain of the appropriate government and it was not open to the High Court to give a\\ndirection of that kind even if the High Court could give such a direction, it could only\\ndirect consideration of the case of premature release by the Government and could not\\nhave ordered the premature release of the respondent itself. The right to exercise the\\npower under section 433 Cr PC, 1973 vests in the Government and has to be exercised\\nby the Government in accordance with the rules and established principles.

Neither section 432 nor section 433 of Cr PC,\\n1973 hence contains a non-obstante provision. Therefore, the minimum sentence\\nprovided for any offence cannot be and shall not be remitted or commuted by the\\nGovernment in exercise of their power under sections 432 or 433 of the Cr PC, 1973.\\nWherever the Indian Penal Code or such penal statutes have provided for a minimum\\nsentence for any offence, to that extent, the power of remission or commutation has to\\nbe read as restricted; otherwise the whole purpose of punishment will be defeated and\\nit will be a mockery on sentencing.174.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",

Section 57 is only for calculating fractions of terms of\\npunishment and provides that imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to\\nimprisonment for 20 years. The object and purpose of section 57 will be clear by simply\\nreferring to sections 65, 116, 119, 129 and 511 of the IPC, 1860.179. The accused has\\nthus no right to be released after a period of 20 years. The remissions granted under\\nthe rules made under the Prison Act or under the Jail Manual are merely administrative\\norders of the appropriate Government and fall exclusively within the discretion of the\\nGovernment under section 401 (now section 432) Cr PC, 1973. In the case of a prisoner\\nwho is convicted in one State but transferred to the jail of another State to serve out the\\nsentence, the appropriate Government to grant remission would be the Government of\\nthe State where the accused was convicted and not that of the transferee\\nGovernment.180.\\n[s 57.1] Life imprisonment.—\\nLife imprisonment means imprisonment for the whole of a convict's natural life. It does\\nnot automatically expire on his serving sentence of 14 years or 20 years, unless, of\\ncourse, the sentence is remitted or commuted by the Government in accordance with\\nthe law181. The Court said that life imprisonment means imprisonment for the whole of\\nthe remaining period of the convict's life. The fact that the West Bengal Correctional\\nServices Act 1992, equates life imprisonment with imprisonment for 20 years does not\\nentitle the convict to automatic release on expiry of such term of imprisonment\\nincluding remission.182.\\n[s 57.2] Punishment for attempt Under Section 511 when the offence\\nattempted is punishable with Life imprisonment.—\\nSection 57 of the IPC, 1860 provides that in calculating fractions of terms of\\npunishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for\\n20 years. In view of this, for the offence of attempt to commit rape punishable under\\nsection 376(2)(a) read with section 511 maximum sentence would be rigorous\\nimprisonment for ten years.183.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 179}),\n",

A distinction between\\n'imprisonment for life' and 'imprisonment for a term' has been maintained in the Indian\\nPenal Code in several of its provisions. Second, by its very terms section 60 is\\napplicable to a case where 'an offender is punishable with imprisonment which may be\\nof either description' and it is only in such case that it is competent for the Court to\\ndirect that 'such imprisonment shall be either wholly rigorous or wholly simple or that\\nany part of such imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple'. And it is clear that\\nwhenever an offender is punishable with 'imprisonment for life' he is not punishable\\nwith 'imprisonment which may be of either description', in other words section 60\\nwould be inapplicable. The position in law as regards the nature of punishment\\ninvolved in a sentence of imprisonment for life is well settled and the sentence of\\nimprisonment for life has to be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life.185.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",

[In every case, of an offence punishable with imprisonment as well as ﬁne, 1 in\\nwhich the offender is sentenced to a ﬁne, whether with or without imprisonment, and\\nin every case of an offence punishable 192.[with imprisonment or ﬁne, or] with ﬁne\\nonly, in which the offender is sentenced to a ﬁne,] it shall be competent to the Court\\nwhich sentences such offender to direct by the sentence that, in default of payment of\\nthe ﬁne, the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which\\nimprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may have\\nbeen sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe term of imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne is not a sentence. It is a penalty\\nwhich a person incurs on account of non-payment of ﬁne. The sentence is something\\nwhich an offender must undergo unless it is set aside or remitted in part or in whole\\neither in appeal or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings or \"otherwise\".\\nA term of imprisonment ordered in default of payment of ﬁne stands on a different\\nfooting. A person is required to undergo imprisonment either because he is unable to\\npay the amount of ﬁne or refuses to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always avoid\\nto undergo imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne by paying such amount. It is,\\ntherefore, not only the power, but also the duty of the Court to keep in view the nature\\nof offence, circumstances under which it was committed, the position of the offender\\nand other relevant considerations before ordering the offender to suffer imprisonment\\nin default of payment of ﬁne.193. A default sentence is no punishment under law. It is\\nonly a method of enforcement of the direction for payment of amounts directed to be\\npaid as ﬁne. Wherever the Criminal Court has the jurisdictional competence to impose\\na ﬁne, sections 64–70, IPC, and section 30 Cr PC, 1973 stipulate that the Court can\\nrecover the same by imposition of a default sentence. The jurisdiction to impose a\\ndefault sentence is only incidental to the power to impose a ﬁne and the duty of the\\nCourt to recover the same.194. The wording of the section is not happy, but the\\nLegislature intended by it to provide for the award of imprisonment in default of\\npayment of ﬁne in all cases in which ﬁne can be imposed to induce the offender to pay\\nthe ﬁne.\\nThe cases falling under this section are:—\\nWhere the offence is punishable with (a) imprisonment with ﬁne, or (b) imprisonment\\nor ﬁne, or (c) ﬁne only, and the offender is sentenced to (i) imprisonment, or (ii) ﬁne, or\\nboth, the Court may sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment in default of\\npayment of ﬁne. A term of imprisonment for non-payment of ﬁne is not a substantive\\nsentence. It is only a penalty for the default. It cannot be added to the substantive\\nsentence so as to see whether the maximum imprisonment that could be awarded for\\nthe offence is not being exceeded.195.\\n1. \\'Imprisonment as well as ﬁne.\\'—Magistrates cannot award compensation in addition\\nto ﬁne.196.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 188}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The full Bench of Madras High Court held that imprisonment in default of payment of\\nﬁne cannot be directed to run concurrently with substantive sentence because both the\\nsentences are distinct in view of sections 53 and 64 IPC, 1860.197.\\n[s 64.1] Sentence and penalty distinguished.—\\nThe term of imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne is not a sentence. It is penalty\\nincurred for non-payment of ﬁne. A sentence is a term of imprisonment, which the\\noffender has to undergo unless it is remitted in a further judicial proceeding or\\notherwise. A term of imprisonment on default in payment of ﬁne stands on a different\\nfooting. The further imprisonment is due to non-payment by refusal or otherwise. The\\nconvict can pay the amount and get rid of further imprisonment.198.\\n[s 64.2] Fine and Compensation.—\\nThere exists a distinction between ﬁne and compensation, although, in a way it seeks\\nto achieve the same purpose. An amount of compensation can be directed to be\\nrecovered as a 'ﬁne' but the legal ﬁction raised in relation to recovery of ﬁne only, it is in\\nthat sense 'ﬁne' stands on a higher footing than compensation awarded by the\\nCourt.199.\\n[s 64.3] Power of Magistrate to impose Sentence of imprisonment in default of\\nﬁne.—\\nAs per section 30 of Cr PC, 1973 the Court of a Magistrate may award such term of\\nimprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne as is authorised by law: provided that the\\nterm is not in excess of the powers of the Magistrate under section 29 Cr PC, 1973; and\\nshall not, where imprisonment has been awarded as part of the substantive sentence,\\nexceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which the Magistrate is competent to\\ninﬂict as punishment for the offence otherwise than as imprisonment in default of\\npayment of the ﬁne. The imprisonment awarded may be in addition to a substantive\\nsentence of imprisonment for the maximum term awardable by the Magistrate under\\nsection 29 of Cr PC, 1973. The default sentence is not to be in excess to the limitations\\nimposed under section 30 Cr PC, 1973.200.\\n[s 64.4] Default sentence on non-payment of Compensation.—\\nUndoubtedly, there is no speciﬁc provision in the Code which enables the Court to\\nsentence a person who commits breach of the order of payment of compensation. But\\nin Hari Singh v Sukhbir Singh,201. Supreme Court held that since the imposition of\\ncompensation under section 357(3) Cr PC, 1973 was on account of social concern, the\\nCourt could enforce the same by imposing sentence in default, particularly when no\\nmode had been prescribed in the Code for recovery of sums awarded as compensation\\nin the event the same remained unpaid. The position is re-iterated in Sugnathi Suresh\\nKumar v Jagdeeshan.202. The provisions of sections 357(3) and 431 Cr PC, 1973 when\\nread with section 64 IPC, 1860 empower the Court, while making an order for payment\\nof compensation, to also include a default sentence in case of non-payment of the\\nsame.203.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 189}),\n",

State v\\nKrishna Pillai Madhavan Pillai, 1953 Cr LJ 1265COMMENT—\\nImprisonment in default of ﬁne does not liberate the offender from his liability to pay\\nthe full amount of ﬁne imposed on him. Such imprisonment is not a discharge or\\nsatisfaction of the ﬁne but is imposed as a punishment for non-payment or contempt\\nor resistance to the due execution of the sentence. The offender cannot be permitted\\nto choose whether he will suffer in his person or his property. His person will cease to\\nbe answerable for the ﬁne. Nevertheless, his property will for a time continue to do so.\\nThe bar of six years may save the property of the accused but not his personal arrest.\\nThe liability for any sentence of imprisonment awarded in default of payment of ﬁne\\ncontinues after the expiration of six years.218. Any proceeding taken after six years to\\nrecover the ﬁne by sale of immoveable property of the offender is time-barred.219. The\\nlimitation starts from the date of passing of the sentence of conviction by the trial\\nCourt and not the date of dismissal of the appeal or revision preferred by the\\naccused.220. The property of the accused is liable for the payment of ﬁne even if he has\\nundergone imprisonment in default of ﬁne and as such even on death of the offender\\ndoes not discharge any property which would after his death, be legally liable for his\\ndebts due from him (including liability) to discharge the ﬁne.221.\\nThe expression \"levy\" in this section means \"to seize\" for the purpose of collecting the\\nﬁne or to enforce execution for a certain sum and not actual realisation.222. Any stay or\\nsuspension obtained from the higher Court has to be excluded in computing the period\\nof six years\\' limitation under section 70 IPC.223. Section 70 says that State shall levy\\nﬁne within six years from the date of sentence. What is contemplated is that the State\\nshall commence recovery proceedings within six years; and, need not be completed it\\nwithin six years of the sentence. Therefore, once a distress warrant is issued within six\\nyears of the sentence, the plea of limitation is out of bounds for the sentence.224.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 198}),\n",

In order to attract provisions of\\nArticle 20(2) of the Constitution, i.e., doctrine of autrefois acquit or section 300 Cr PC,\\n1973 or section 71 IPC, 1860 or section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897\\ningredients of the offences in the earlier case as well as in the latter case must be the\\nsame and not different. The test to ascertain whether the two offences are the same is\\nnot identity of the allegations but the identity of the ingredients of the offence.228.\\nThe rules for assessment of punishment are laid down in sections 71 and 72 of the\\nIPC, 1860 and section 31 of the Cr PC, 1973. Section 31 of the Code of Criminal\\nProcedure provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more\\noffences, the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 71 of the IPC, 1860,\\nsentence him, for such offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefor which\\nsuch Court is competent to inﬂict; and in the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not\\nbe necessary for the Court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several\\noffence being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inﬂict on conviction\\nof a single offences, to send the offender for trial before a higher Court. It, therefore,\\nenhances the ordinary powers of sentences given to Magistrates by section 29, Cr PC,\\n1973; but in order to bring a case within the purview of this section, the accused must\\nhave been convicted of two or more offences in the same trial, and the sentence for\\nany one of these offences should not exceed the limits of their ordinary powers. The\\nlimits ﬁxed by this section refer to sentences passed simultaneously, or upon charges\\nwhich are tried simultaneously. Sentences of imprisonment passed under it may run\\nconcurrently. When an accused is convicted at one trial of two or more offences,\\nsection 31(1) of Cr PC, 1973 vests discretion in Court to direct that punishment shall\\nrun concurrently. Court may sentence the accused for such offences to several\\npunishments prescribed therefor, and such punishment would consist of imprisonment\\nto commence, one after expiration of other in such order as the Court may direct,\\nsubject to limitation contained in section 71 of IPC, 1860.229.\\n[s 71.1] Illustration (a).—\\n\"A gives Z ﬁfty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of\\nvoluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which\\nmake up whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be\\nimprisoned for 50years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for\\nthe whole beating.\" It is to be noted that the whole beating is considered to constitute\\none offence while each of the blows also amounted to the offence of voluntarily\\ncausing hurt. It can be said, therefore, that while the obtaining of money by cheating on\\nthe presentation of an individual bill did constitute the offence of cheating the\\nobtaining of the entire money in pursuance of the terms of the single contract and the\\nsingle conspiracy entered into also constituted the offence of cheating. When the\\naccused could not be punished with the punishment for more than one such offence it\\ncannot be the intention of law that the accused be charged with each of the offences,\\nwhich were in a way included in the complete offence made up by the entire course of\\nconduct of the accused in pursuance of the conspiracy.230.\\n[s 71.2] Section 71 IPC and section 220 Cr PC.—\\nSection 71 of the IPC, 1860 has to be read in conjunction with section 220 of the Cr PC,\\n1973. It should, however, be remembered that section 220 Cr PC, 1973 contains only\\nrules of criminal pleading in regard to joinder of charges and does not deal with the\\nsentence to be passed on the charges of the offences mentioned in the several\\nillustrations thereunder. Sub-section (5) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 makes this position\\nabundantly clear. A joint reading of section 71 IPC, 1860 and section 220 Cr PC, 1973\\nclearly shows that clause (2) of section 71 IPC, 1860 approximates sub-section (3) of', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 201}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='section 220 Cr PC, 1973 and clause (3) of section 71 IPC, 1860 corresponds to sub-\\nsection (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973. It, therefore, follows that the embargo on\\nseparate sentence under section 71 IPC, 1860 applies only to cases falling within sub-\\nsections (3) and (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 and not under, for example, sub-section\\n(1) of that section.231. Thus in cases covered by illustrations (i), (j) and (k) to sub-\\nsection (3) and illustration (m) to sub-section (4) of section 220 Cr PC, though the\\noffences mentioned therein could be tried together and conviction recorded in regard\\nto each one of them, yet no separate sentences could be passed in view of the\\nembargo contained in section 71 IPC, 1860. Similarly, where the accused was\\nconvicted and sentenced under section 147 IPC, 1860 a separate sentence under\\nsection 143 IPC, 1860 could not be passed.232. In the same way when an accused is\\nconvicted for a more serious offence, e.g., under section 148 IPC, 1860 a separate\\nsentence under section 147 IPC, 1860 is not only uncalled for but illegal.233. It,\\ntherefore, means that cases falling under sub-section (1) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973\\nwhere several distinct offences are committed in course of the same transaction, the\\naccused cannot only be tried and convicted of all of them at one trial but even separate\\nsentences can be passed in regard to each one of them. Thus, where a person\\ncommits lurking house-trespass by night (section 457 IPC, 1860) and also commits\\ntheft (section 380 IPC, 1860) in course of the same transaction, he can be convicted\\nand sentenced separately for both of them.234. Though the offence under section 420,\\nIPC, 1860 and offence under section 138, N.I. Act are very distinct and their ingredients\\nare different, still both the offences were committed during the same transaction;\\naccused could have been charged and tried for both the offences during single trial as\\nper section 220, Cr PC, 1973. However, from the language of section 220, it appears to\\nbe enabling provision whereby two or more different offences may be tried together by\\nthe Court and not mandatory.235.\\n[s 71.3] CASES.—\\n1.It was contended that the accused having caused the evidence of the two offences\\nunder sections 330 and 348 to disappear, committed two separate offences under\\nsection 201 and are punishable accordingly. Taking a strict view of the matter, it must\\nbe said that by the same act the appellants committed two offences under section 201.\\nThe case is not covered either by section 71 of the IPC, 1860 or by section 26 of the\\nGeneral Clauses Act, and the punishment for the two offences cannot be limited under\\nthose sections. But, normally, no Court should award two separate punishments for the\\nsame act constituting two offences under section 201. The appropriate sentence under\\nsection 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 330 to disappear\\nshould be passed, and no separate sentence need be passed under section 201 for\\ncausing the evidence of the offence under section 348 to disappear.236. Where death\\nwas caused by rash and negligent driving of a truck and the accused could be\\nconvicted under sections 279 and also under sections 304A, it was held that a separate\\nsentence under sections 279 could not be imposed.237.\\n[s 71.4] Rioting and grievous hurt.—\\nThe illustration (a) to section 71 IPC makes it clear that where only an offence is made\\nup of many parts, and then only, the offender shall not be punished for more than one\\nsuch offence. When the offences are separate and distinct and do not constitute parts\\nof one offence, the accused can be convicted separately for each one of the offences.\\nTherefore, the argument that the sentence both under sections 148 and 324, IPC is\\nopposed to section 71, IPC is not acceptable.238.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 202}),\n",

It is inﬂicted in order that a feeling of loneliness\\nmay produce wholesome inﬂuence and reform the criminal. This section gives the\\nscale according to which solitary conﬁnement may be inﬂicted.

The well-known\\nprinciple of law is that the convict carrying death punishment is not deemed to be\\n'prisoner under sentence of death' unless death sentence becomes ﬁnal, conclusive\\nand beyond judicial scrutiny. Such convict is handed over to the jail authority to be kept\\nin safe and protected custody with purpose that he may be available for execution of\\nthe sentence eventually conﬁrmed.

What section 75 IPC, 1860 contemplates is that\\nwhere a person who has been, previously convicted of an offence punishable under\\nChapter XII (which deals with offences relating to coin and Government stamps) or\\nChapter XVII. (which relates to offences against property) with imprisonment of either\\ndescription for a term of three years or up-wards, is once again found guilty of a similar\\noffence, he shall be liable to enhanced punishment which may extend to imprisonment\\nfor life or to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten\\nyears. The section is concerned with a previous conviction for a similar offence but it\\ndoes not postulate that in respect of the previous conviction, the punishment imposed\\nshould have been one of not less than three years. All that it posits is that the previous\\nconviction should have been in respect of an offence punishable with a term of\\nimprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, but it does not lay down that the\\noffender should have been actually punished with such a term of imprisonment.257. It\\ndoes not apply to offences under other Acts.258.\\n1. 'Having been convicted'.—A plain reading of this provision goes to show that the\\nprevious conviction ought to be for offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter\\nXVII and the sentence imposed is three years or more than that. If the sentence is less\\nthan three years or the offence does not fall within any of the two Chapters then\\nsection 75, IPC, 1860 would not be applicable. If any authority is required then\\nreference may be made to Re Kamya,259. wherein it has been held that the minimum\\nrequired for enhancement of punishment under section 75, IPC, 1860 is that the\\nprevious conviction of the accused should have resulted in punishment of three years\\nor more.260.

What section 75 IPC, 1860 contemplates is that\\nwhere a person who has been, previously convicted of an offence punishable under\\nChapter XII (which deals with offences relating to coin and Government stamps) or\\nChapter XVII. (which relates to offences against property) with imprisonment of either\\ndescription for a term of three years or up-wards, is once again found guilty of a similar\\noffence, he shall be liable to enhanced punishment which may extend to imprisonment\\nfor life or to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten\\nyears. The section is concerned with a previous conviction for a similar offence but it\\ndoes not postulate that in respect of the previous conviction, the punishment imposed\\nshould have been one of not less than three years. All that it posits is that the previous\\nconviction should have been in respect of an offence punishable with a term of\\nimprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, but it does not lay down that the\\noffender should have been actually punished with such a term of imprisonment.257. It\\ndoes not apply to offences under other Acts.258.\\n1. 'Having been convicted'.—A plain reading of this provision goes to show that the\\nprevious conviction ought to be for offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter\\nXVII and the sentence imposed is three years or more than that. If the sentence is less\\nthan three years or the offence does not fall within any of the two Chapters then\\nsection 75, IPC, 1860 would not be applicable. If any authority is required then\\nreference may be made to Re Kamya,259. wherein it has been held that the minimum\\nrequired for enhancement of punishment under section 75, IPC, 1860 is that the\\nprevious conviction of the accused should have resulted in punishment of three years\\nor more.260. Section 75 is invoked for enhancement of the sentence and that can come\\nonly at the time the sentence is to be imposed.

If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860.

Section 76 excuses a person who has done what by law is an offence,\\nunder a misconception of facts, leading him to believe in good faith that he was\\ncommanded by law to do it. See Comment on section 79, infra.\\nThis section and sections 77, 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person bound or justiﬁed by\\nlaw.

'Mistake of law'.—See Comment under section 79, infra.\\n3. 'In good faith believes himself to be, bound by law'.—In order to entitle a person to\\nclaim the beneﬁt of this section it is necessary to show the existence of a state of facts\\nwhich would justify the belief in good faith, interpreting the latter expression with\\nreference to section 52, that the person to whom the order was given was bound by law\\nto obey it. Thus, in the case of a soldier, the Penal Code does not recognize the mere\\nduty of blind obedience to the commands of a superior as suﬃcient to protect him\\nfrom the penal consequences of his act. But in certain circumstances a soldier\\nreceives absolute protection under section 132 of the Cr PC, 1973.\\nFor illegal acts, however, neither the orders of a parent nor a master nor a superior will\\nfurnish any defence. Nothing but fear of instant death is a defence for a policeman who\\ntortures anyone by order of a superior. The maxim respondeat superior has no\\napplication to such a case.6. The net position appears to be that if superior order is in\\nconformity with the law no further question arises and the subordinate oﬃcer is\\nprotected by section 76 IPC, 1860, if he carries out that order. It is only when the order\\nis not in accordance with the law but the subordinate oﬃcer who carries out that order\\nin good faith, on account of a mistake of fact and not on ground of mistake of law,\\nbelieves himself to be bound by law to carry out such an order, that a further question\\narises as to whether the subordinate oﬃcer will not still get protection of section 76\\nIPC, 1860, because of his mistake of fact. Thus, where the order was legal in the\\ncircumstances of the case, e.g., where the police patrol party opened ﬁre under the\\norder of the Deputy Commissioner of Police after it had been attacked on a dark night\\nand an Assistant Commissioner of Police had been injured as a result of such attack,\\nreally no question arose for the application of section 76 IPC, 1860, as the order was\\nboth legal and justiﬁed by the circumstances of the case.7. The Indian law as contained\\nin sections 76 and 79 of the Penal Code appears to be the same as in England.

A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in\\nself-defence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nDistinction between Sections 76 and 79.—The distinction between section 76 and this\\nsection is that in the former a person is assumed to be bound, and in the latter to be\\njustiﬁed, by law; in other words, the distinction is between a real or supposed legal\\nobligation and a real or supposed legal justiﬁcation, in doing the particular act. Under\\nboth (these sections) there must be a bona ﬁde intention to advance the law,\\nmanifested by the circumstances attending the act which is the subject of charge; and\\nthe party accused cannot allege generally that he had a good motive, but must allege\\nspeciﬁcally that he believed in good faith that he was bound by law (section 76) to do\\nas he did, or that being empowered by law (section 79) to act in the matter, he had\\nacted to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith.14.\\n1. Any person who is justiﬁed by law.—Jurisprudentially viewed, an act may be an\\noffence, deﬁnitionally speaking but a forbidden act may not spell inevitable guilt if the\\nlaw itself declares that in certain special circumstances it is not to be regarded as an\\noffence. The chapter on General Exceptions operates in this province. Section 79\\nmakes an offence a non-offence. When? Only when the offending act is actually\\njustiﬁed by law or is bona ﬁde believed by mistake of fact to be so justiﬁed.15. It is easy\\nto see that if the act complained of is wholly justiﬁed by law, it would not amount to an\\noffence at all in view of the provisions of section 79 of the IPC, 1860. Many cases may\\nhowever arise wherein acting under the provisions of the Police Act or other law\\nconferring powers on the police, the police oﬃcer or some other person may go beyond\\nwhat is strictly justiﬁed in law. Though section 79 of the IPC, 1860 will have no\\napplication to such cases, section 53 of the Police Act will apply. But section 53 applies\\nto only a limited class of persons. So, it becomes the task of the Court, whenever any\\nquestion whether this section applies or not arises to bestow particular care on its\\ndecision. In doing this it has to ascertain ﬁrst, what act is complained of and then to\\nexamine, if there is any provision of the Police Act or other law conferring powers on\\nthe police, under which it may be said to have been done or intended to be done. The\\nCourt has to remember in this connection that an act is not \"under\" a provision of law\\nmerely because the point of time at which it is done coincides with the point of time\\nwhen some act is done in the exercise of the powers granted by the provision or in\\nperformance of the duty imposed by it. To be able to say that an act is done \"under\" a\\nprovision of law, one must discover the existence of a reasonable relationship between\\nthe provisions and the act. In the absence of such a relation the act cannot be said to\\nbe done \"under\" the particular provision of law.16. But unless there is a reasonable\\nconnection between the act complained of and the powers and duties of the oﬃce, it\\ncannot be said that the act was done by the accused oﬃcer under the colour of his\\noﬃce.17. In Bhanuprasad Hariprasad Dave\\'s case,18. wherein the allegations against the\\npolice oﬃcer was of taking advantage of his position and attempting to coerce a\\nperson to give him a bribe. The plea of colour of duty was negatived by the Supreme\\nCourt. In Prof. Sumer Chand v UOI, 1994 (1) SCC 64 [LNIND 1993 SC 665] Supreme\\nCourt on facts endorsed the opinion of the High Court that the act of the Police Oﬃcer\\ncomplained of fell within the description of `colour of duty\\'. The argument is irresistible\\nthat if the performance of the act which constitutes the offence is justiﬁed by law, i.e.,', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 227}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='by some other provision, then section 79 exonerates the doer because the act ceases\\nto be an offence. Likewise, if the act were done by one \\'who by reason of a mistake of\\nfact in good faith believes himself to be justiﬁed by law in doing it\\' then also, the\\nexception operates and the bona ﬁde belief, although mistaken, eliminates the\\nculpability. If the offender can irrefutably establish that he is actually justiﬁed by law in\\ndoing the act or, alternatively, that he entertained a mistake of fact and in good faith\\nbelieved that he was justiﬁed by law in committing the act, then, the weapon of section\\n79 demolishes the prosecution.19.\\n2. \\'Mistake of fact\\'.—Under this section, although an act may not be justiﬁed by law, yet\\nif it is done under a mistake of fact, in the belief in good faith that it is justiﬁed by law it\\nwill not be an offence. Such cases are not uncommon where the Courts in the facts\\nand circumstances of the particular case have exonerated the accused under section\\n79 on the ground of having acted in good faith under the belief, owing to a mistake of\\nfact that he was justiﬁed in doing the act which constituted an offence. As laid down in\\nsection 52 of the IPC, 1860, nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is\\ndone or believed without due care and attention. The question of good faith must be\\nconsidered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under\\nwhich he acted. \\'Good faith\\' requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention.\\nThe question of good faith is always a question of fact to be determined in accordance\\nwith the proved facts and circumstances of each case.20.\\n\\'Mistake\\' is not mere forgetfulness.21. It is a slip \"made, not by design, but by\\nmischance.\"22. Under sections 76 and 79 a mistake must be one of fact and not of law.\\nAt common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances,\\nwhich, if true, would make the act for which a prisoner is indicted an innocent act has\\nalways been held to be a good defence. Honest and reasonable mistake stands in fact\\non the same footing as absence of the reasoning faculty, as in infancy, or perversion of\\nthat faculty, as in lunacy.23. It may be laid down as a general rule that an alleged\\noffender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he in good faith and\\non reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an\\noffence.24. Ignorantia facti doth excusat, for such ignorance many times makes the act\\nitself morally involuntary.25. Where a man made a thrust with a sword at a place where,\\nupon reasonable grounds, he supposed a burglar to be, and killed a person who was\\nnot a burglar, it was held that he had committed no offence.26. In other words, he was\\nin the same situation as far as regards the homicide as if he had killed a burglar. The\\naccused while guarding his maize ﬁeld shot an arrow at a moving object in the bona\\nﬁde belief that it was a bear and in the process caused the death of a man who was\\nhiding there. It was held that he could not be held liable for murder as his case was\\nfully covered by section 79 as well as section 80 IPC, 1860.27. Similarly, where the\\naccused while helping the police stopped a cart which they in good faith believed to be\\ncarrying smuggled rice but ultimately their suspicion proved to be incorrect, it was held\\nthat they could not be prosecuted for wrongful restraint under section 341 as their case\\nwas covered by section 79 IPC, 1860.28. Section 79 makes an offence a non-offence.\\nThus, where the Board of Censors, acting within their jurisdiction and on an application\\nmade and pursued in good faith sanctions the public exhibition of a ﬁlm, the producer\\nand the connected agencies do enter the statutory harbour and are protected from\\nprosecution under section 292 IPC, 1860, because section 79 of the Code exonerates\\nthem at least in view of their bona ﬁde belief that the certiﬁcate is justiﬁcatory.29.\\n3. \\'Mistake of law\\'.—Mistake in point of law in a criminal case is no defence. Mistake of\\nlaw ordinarily means mistake as to the existence or otherwise of any law on a relevant\\nsubject as well as mistake as to what the law is.30.\\nIgnorance of the municipal law of the Kingdom, or of the penalty thereby inﬂicted upon\\noffenders, doth not excuse any, that is of the age of discretion and compos mentis, from the', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 228}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"penalty of the breach of it; because every person of the age of discretion and compos\\nmentis is bound to know the law, and presumed so to do.31.\\nIf any individual should infringe the statute law of the country through ignorance or\\ncarelessness, he must abide by the consequences of his error; it is not competent to\\nhim to aver in a Court of Justice that he was ignorant of the law of the land, and no\\nCourt of Justice is at liberty to receive such a plea.32.\\nThe maxim ignorantia juris non excusat, in its application to criminal offences, admits of\\nno exception, not even in the case of a foreigner who cannot reasonably be supposed\\nin fact to know the law of the land.33. The legal presumption that everyone knows the\\nlaw of the land is often untrue as a matter of fact. But then why such a presumption\\nsubsists? The reason for this seems to be nothing but expediency; otherwise there is\\nno knowing of the extent to which the excuse of ignorance of law might be carried.\\nIndeed, it might be urged almost in every case.34. This rule of expediency has been put\\nto use even in a case where the accused could not have possibly known the law in the\\ncircumstances in which he was placed. Thus, a person who was on the high seas and\\nas such could not have been cognizant of a recently passed law might be convicted for\\ncontravening it.35.\\nWhenever the question of justiﬁcation of an offence either due to mistake of fact or\\nmistake of law arises, the guiding rules are: (1) that when an act is in itself plainly\\ncriminal, and is more severely punishable if certain circumstances co-exist, ignorance\\nof the existence of such circumstances is no answer to a charge for the aggravated\\noffence. (2) That where an act is prima facie innocent and proper, unless certain\\ncircumstances co-exist, then ignorance of such circumstances is an answer to the\\ncharge. (3) That the state of the defendant's mind must amount to absolute ignorance\\nof the existence of the circumstance which alters the character of the act, or to a belief\\nin its non-existence. (4) Where an act which is in itself wrong is, under certain\\ncircumstances, criminal, a person who does the wrong act cannot set up as a defence\\nthat he was ignorant of the facts which turned the wrong into a crime. (5) Where a\\nstatute makes it penal to do an act under certain circumstances, it is a question upon\\nthe wording and object of the particular statute, whether the responsibility of\\nascertaining that the circumstances exist is thrown upon the person who does the act\\nor not. In the former case his knowledge is immaterial.36.\\n[s 79.1] Ignorance of statute newly passed.—\\nAlthough a person commits an act which is made an offence for the ﬁrst time by a\\nstatute so recently passed as to render it impossible that any notice of the passing of\\nthe statute could have reached the place where the offence has been committed, yet\\nhis ignorance of the statute will not save him from punishment.37.

The\\nreasonableness or otherwise of the belief was only material to the question of whether\\nthe belief was in fact held by the defendant at all.43.\\n[s 79.7] Bad defence.—\\nDeceased attempted to steal coconut from the garden of which accused was a\\nwatchman. Accused contended that, he while discharging his duties as a watchman in\\ngood faith and under mistake of fact inﬂicted an injury which unfortunately resulted in\\nthe death of the victim. Explaining the applicability of section 79, Supreme Court held\\nthat there was no mistake of fact which could even if existed or found true could\\nwarrant or justify in law, the imposition of such a serious injury as found inﬂicted on the\\nvictim.44. A police-oﬃcer saw a horse tied up in B's premises and because it happened\\nto resemble one which his father had lost a short time previously, he jumped at once to\\nthe conclusion that B had either stolen the horse himself, or purchased it from the thief,\\nand compelled B to account for his possession. The oﬃcer found that B had bought\\nthe animal from one S; so he sent for S, charged him with the theft, and compelled him\\nto give bail whilst an investigation was pending. The oﬃcer never sent for the\\nsupposed owner of the horse, or took the trouble of getting any credible information as\\nto whether it was his father's horse or not. It was held that the police-oﬃcer had not\\nacted in good faith, that is, with due care and attention and that this section did not\\nprotect him.45. The accused struck a person with a full force lathi blow thinking that he\\nwas a thief and he had to do so to safeguard his property. The incident took place\\noutside the house near a pond. The place was away from the house.

Therefore, general exceptions are part of deﬁnition of every\\noffence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the\\naccused.1.\\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\\n1.Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\\n2.Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\\n3.Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\\n4.Act of a person justiﬁed, or believing himself justiﬁed, by law (section 79).\\n5.Act caused by accident (section 80).\\n6.Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm\\n(section 81).\\n7.Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\\n8.Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding\\n(section 83).\\n9.Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\\n10.Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\\n11.Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of\\nthe sufferer (section 87).\\n12.Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\\n13.Act done in good faith for the beneﬁt of a child or an insane person by or by the\\nconsent of guardian (section 89).\\n14.Act done in good faith for the beneﬁt of a person without consent (section 92).\\n15.Communication made in good faith to a person for his beneﬁt (section 93).\\n16.Act done under threat of death (section 94).\\n17.Act causing slight harm (section 95).', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 234}),\n",

If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860.

This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC,\\n1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, deﬁnition of every offence is to be\\nunderstood subject to the \"General Exceptions\".

Depending on facts and\\ncircumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated\\ninto, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\".

Here, if\\nthere was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an\\noffence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nThis section exempts the doer of an innocent or lawful act in an innocent or lawful\\nmanner and without any criminal intention or knowledge from any unforeseen evil\\nresult that may ensue from accident or misfortune.48. To claim the beneﬁt of this\\nprovision it has to be shown:\\n(1)that the act in question was without any criminal intention or knowledge;\\n(2)that the act was being done in a lawful manner by lawful means; and\\n(3)that act was being done with proper care and caution.49.\\n1. \\'Accident\\'.—An effect is said to be accidental when the act by which it is caused is\\nnot done with the intention of causing it, and when its occurrence as a consequence of\\nsuch act is not so probable that a person of ordinary prudence ought, under the\\ncircumstances in which it is done, to take reasonable precautions against it.50. An\\naccident is something that happens out of the ordinary course of things.51. The idea of\\nsomething fortuitous and unexpected is involved in the word \\'accident.\\'52. Where two\\nbrothers were sleeping together and one of them while in a state of semi-sleep felt that\\nsomebody was throttling him, picked up the dao, kept on the head of the bed, and\\nadministered a blow which was received by his sleeping brother who died, there being\\nneither intention nor motive, the accused was let off under this section. His act was not\\nvoluntary.53.\\nAn injury is said to be accidentally caused whensoever it is neither wilfully nor\\nnegligently caused.54. Where the accused ﬁred a shot at his assailant who escaped but\\nfour other persons were injured and one of them unfortunately expired, it was held that\\nthe accused was not liable for the fatal injury to an innocent person as his case fell\\nwithin the scope of section 80 read with sections 96 and 100, IPC, 1860.55. Shooting\\nwith an unlicensed gun does not debar an accused from claiming immunity under this\\nsection.56.\\n[s 80.1] Medical Negligence.—\\nTo prosecute a medical professional for negligence under criminal law it must be\\nshown that the accused did something or failed to do something which in the given\\nfacts and circumstances no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence\\nwould have done or failed to do. The hazard taken by the accused doctor should be of\\nsuch a nature that the injury which resulted was most likely imminent.57. In Dr. Suresh\\nGupta v Govt. of NCT of Delhi,58. the Apex Court held that where the medical practitioner\\nfailed to take appropriate steps, viz., \"not putting a cuffed endotracheal tube of proper\\nsize\" so as to prevent aspiration of blood blocking respiratory passage, the act\\nattributed to him may be described as negligent act but not so reckless as to make him\\ncriminally liable. In Kusum Sharma v Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre,59. the\\nSupreme Court reiterated the legal position after taking survey of catena of case law.

The criminal liability cannot be fastened on the\\nMedical Practitioner unless the negligence is so obvious and of such high degree that it\\nwould be culpable by applying the settled norms.60.\\n[s 80.2] CASES.—\\nDeceased allegedly dashed by offending tractor and crushed by its wheels. The\\nSteering bolt of steering wheel was evidently broken all of a sudden. Offending vehicle\\nbecame free and was out of control. Incident was merely an accident and not an act of\\nrashness or negligence on the part of the accused.61. Where the act of the accused is\\nitself of criminal nature, the protection of this section cannot be availed. In this case,\\nthe accused picked up his gun, unlocked it, loaded it with cartridges, aimed at the chest\\nof the victim from a close range of 4–5 feet and shot it. Quite naturally this section was\\nheld to be not applicable. There could be no suggestion of an accident.62. Where the\\nDeath is caused by shooting an arrow under bona ﬁde belief that object aimed at was\\nan animal, accused is entitled to the beneﬁt under sections 79 or 80.63. The accused\\nwas attacked when he was asleep at night by his brother who tried to strangulate him.\\nApprehending imminent death, the accused aimed a blow at his assailant brother with\\na piece of bamboo on which he could lay hand and the blow accidentally struck the\\nhead of his intervening father as a result of which he ultimately died. It was held that\\nthe accused exercised his lawful right of self- defence and the blow fell on the head of\\nhis father by accident and misfortune and he was fully protected by sections 80 and\\n106. His conviction under section 304 Part II was set aside.64.\\n[s 80.3] Burden of Proof.—\\nThe prosecution alleges that the accused intentionally shot the deceased; but the\\naccused pleads that, though the shots emanated from his revolver and hit the\\ndeceased, it was by accident, that is, the shots went off from the revolver in the course\\nof a struggle in the circumstances mentioned in section 80 of the IPC, 1860 and hit the\\ndeceased resulting in his death. The Court then shall presume the absence of\\ncircumstances bringing the case within the provisions of section 80 of the IPC, 1860,\\nthat is, it shall presume that the shooting was not by accident, and that the other\\ncircumstances bringing the case within the exception did not exist. But this\\npresumption may be rebutted by the accused by adducing evidence to support his plea\\nof accident in the circumstances mentioned therein. This presumption may also be\\nrebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited by the evidence led by the\\nprosecution or by the combined effect of such circumstances and the evidence\\nadduced by the accused. But the section does not in any way affect the burden that lies\\non the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence with which the accused is\\ncharged and that burden never shifts.65.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 237}),\n",

Here, if A alters his course without any intention to\\nrun down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to\\nthe passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run\\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if\\nit be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was\\nsuch as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C.\\n(b)A, in a great ﬁre, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conﬂagration from\\nspreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or\\nproperty. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature\\nand so imminent as to excuse A's act. A is not guilty of the offence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nAn act which would otherwise be a crime may in some cases be excused if the person\\naccused can show that it was done only in order to avoid consequences which could\\nnot otherwise be avoided, and which, if they had followed, would have inﬂicted upon\\nhim or upon others whom he was bound to protect inevitable and irreparable evil, that\\nno more was done than was reasonably necessary for that purpose, and that the evil\\ninﬂicted by it was not disproportionate to the evil avoided.66. As in self-defence so in\\nthe prevention of harm the accused is faced with two choices both resulting in some\\nharm and of sheer necessity to avoid a greater harm he has to commit an act which\\nwould otherwise be an offence. The test really is like this: there must be a situation in\\nwhich the accused is confronted with a grave danger and he has no choice but to\\ncommit the lesser harm may be even to an innocent person, in order to avoid the\\ngreater harm. Here the choice is between the two evils and the accused rightly chooses\\nthe lesser one.67.\\n1. 'Without any criminal intention'.—Under no circumstances can a person be justiﬁed\\nin intentionally causing harm; but if he causes the harm without any criminal intention,\\nand merely with the knowledge that it is likely to ensue, he will not be held responsible\\nfor the result of his act, provided it be done in good faith to avoid or prevent other harm\\nto person or property.\\n'Criminal intention' simply means the purpose of design or doing an act forbidden by\\nthe criminal law without just cause or excuse. An act is intentional if it exists in idea\\nbefore it exists in fact, the idea realizing itself in the fact because of the desire by which\\nit is accompanied. The motive for an act is not a suﬃcient test to determine its criminal\\ncharacter. By a motive is meant anything that can contribute to give birth to, or even to\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 241}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='prevent, any kind of action. Motive may serve as a clue to the intention; but although\\nthe motive is pure, the act done under it may be criminal. Purity of motive will not purge\\nan act of its criminal character.\\nWhere an offence depends upon proof of intention the Court must have proof of facts\\nsuﬃcient to justify in coming to the conclusion that the intention existed. No doubt one\\nhas usually to infer intention from conduct, and one matter that has to be taken into\\naccount is the probable effect of the conduct. But that is never conclusive.68.\\nWhere the positive evidence against the accused is clear, cogent and reliable, the\\nquestion of motive is of no importance.69.\\n[s 81.1] Mens rea.—\\nIt is a well settled principle of common law that mens rea is an essential ingredient of\\ncriminal offence. A statute can exclude that element, but it is a sound rule of\\nconstruction adopted in England and also accepted in India to construe a statutory\\nprovision creating an offence in conformity with the common law rather than against it\\nunless the statute expressly or by necessary implication excludes mens rea. There is a\\npresumption that mens rea is an essential ingredient of a statutory offence; but this\\nmay be rebutted by the express words of a statute creating the offence or by necessary\\nimplication. But the mere fact that the object of a statute is to promote welfare\\nactivities or to eradicate grave social evils is in itself not decisive of the question\\nwhether the element of guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of the offence. It is\\nalso necessary to enquire whether a statute by putting a person under strict liability\\nhelps him to assist the State in the enforcement of the law; can he do anything to\\npromote the observance of the law? Mens rea by necessary implication can be\\nexcluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that the implementation of the\\nobject of a statute would otherwise be defeated and its exclusion enables those put\\nunder strict liability by their act or omission to assist the promotion of the law. The\\nnature of mens rea that will be implied in a statute creating an offence depends upon\\nthe object of the Act and the provisions thereof.70.\\nIt is, however, held that mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence except in\\nthree cases:\\n(1)cases not criminal in any real sense but which in the public interest are\\nprohibited under a penalty;\\n(2)public nuisance; and\\n(3)cases criminal in form but which are really only a summary mode of enforcing a\\ncivil right.\\nThe maxim actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea has, however, no application in its\\ntechnical sense to the offences under the Penal Code, as the deﬁnitions of various\\noffences contain expressly a proposition as to the state of mind of the accused. In\\nother words, each offence under the Code except offences like waging war (section\\n121), sedition (section 124A), kidnapping and abduction (sections 359, 363) and\\ncounterfeiting coins (section 232) prescribes a mens rea of a speciﬁc kind which is not\\nexactly the same as mens rea in the sense of being a guilty mind under the common\\nlaw. Thus, throughout the web of the IPC, 1860 the doctrine of mens rea runs as a\\nrunning thread in the form of \"intentionally\", \"voluntarily\", \"knowingly\", \"fraudulently\",\\n\"dishonestly\" and the like. It is, therefore, not entirely correct to say that the doctrine of\\nmens rea is inapplicable to the offence under the Penal Code. What the Code requires\\nis not negation of mens rea but mens rea of a speciﬁc kind and this may differ from\\noffence-to-offence.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 242}),\n",

At the trial of an indictment for murder it\\nappeared that the prisoners D and S, seamen, and the deceased, a boy between 17 and\\n18, were cast away in a storm on the high seas, and compelled to put into an open\\nboat; that the boat was drifting on the ocean and was probably more than 1,000 miles\\nfrom land; that on the 18th day, when they had been seven days without food and ﬁve\\ndays without water, D proposed to S that lots should be cast who should be put to\\ndeath to save the rest, and that they afterwards thought it would be better to kill the boy\\nthat their lives should be saved; that on the 20th day, D with the assent of S, killed the\\nboy, and both D and S fed on his ﬂesh for four days; that at the time of the act there\\nwas no sail in sight nor any reasonable prospect of relief; that under these\\ncircumstances there appeared to the prisoners every probability that unless they then\\nor very soon fed upon the boy, or one of themselves, they would die of starvation. It\\nwas held that upon these facts there was no proof of any such necessity as could\\njustify the prisoners in killing the boy, and that they were guilty of murder.75. A and B,\\nswimming in the sea after shipwreck, get hold of a plank not large enough to support\\nboth; A pushes off B, who is drowned.

       " Document(page_content=\"COMMENT.—\\nWhere the accused is a child above seven years of age and under twelve, the incapacity\\nto commit an offence only arises when the child has not attained suﬃcient maturity of\\nunderstanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct, and such non-\\nattainment would have apparently to be specially pleaded and proved, like the\\nincapacity of a person who, at the time of doing an act charged as an offence, was\\nalleged to have been of unsound mind under this section it has got to be shown that\\nthe accused is not only under 12 but has not attained suﬃcient maturity of\\nunderstanding. If no evidence or circumstance is brought to the notice of the Court, it\\nwill be presumed that the child accused intended to do what he really did. Thus, where\\na child of 12 or so used a sharp sword in killing a person along with his two brothers\\nand no evidence either of age or immaturity of understanding was led on his behalf, it\\nwas held that he committed an offence at least under section 326, IPC, 1860.81. The\\nLegislature is manifestly referring in this section to an exceptional immaturity of\\nintellect.82. What the section contemplates is that the child should not know the nature\\nand physical consequences of his conduct.83. The circumstances of a case may\\ndisclose such a degree of malice as to justify the maxim malitia supplet octatem.84.\\nWhere the accused, a boy over 11 years but below 12 years of age, picked up his knife\\nand advanced towards the deceased with a threatening gesture, saying that he would\\ncut him to bits, and did actually cut him, his entire action can only lead to one inference,\\nnamely, that he did what he intended to do and that he knew all the time that a blow\\ninﬂicted with a kathi (knife) would effectuate his intention.85. In the prosecution of an\\n11-year-old child for throwing a brick at a police vehicle and then running away, the\\nCourt said that the justices were not entitled to conclude from his appearance that he\\nwas normal in respect of incurring criminal responsibility. The test is whether the child\\nknew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and went beyond childish mischief.\\nRunning away was not by itself suﬃcient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. A\\nnaughty child would run away from a parent or teacher even if what he had done was\\nnot criminal.86.\\n[s 83.1] CASE.—Theft by child.—\\nWhere a child of nine years of age stole a necklace, worth Rs. 280, and immediately\\nafterwards sold it to the accused for ﬁve annas, the accused could be convicted of\\nreceiving stolen property, because the act of the child in selling the necklace showed\\nthat he had attained a suﬃcient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and\\nconsequences of his conduct on that occasion within the meaning of this section.87.\\nSection 83 provides that nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven\\nyears of age and under 12, who has not attained suﬃcient maturity of understanding to\\njudge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. The IPC, 1860\\nprovides no protection from culpable liability on ground of tender age to one who is\\naged 12 years or more. In a child's life the period between seven and 12 years of age is\\nrather the twilight period of transition to a minimal workable level of understanding of\\nthings in the ﬁrmament of worldly affairs. And that is why both the IPC, 1860 and the\\nOaths Act have made special provisions for children below 12 years in respect of\\nmatters dependent on a minimal power of understanding.88.\\nA claim of juvenility may be raised before any Court and it shall be recognised at any\\nstage, even after ﬁnal disposal of the case.89.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 250}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='COMMENT.—\\nTo commit a criminal offence, mens rea is generally taken to be an essential element of\\ncrime. It is said furiosus nulla voluntus est. In other words, a person who is suffering\\nfrom a mental disorder cannot be said to have committed a crime as he does not know\\nwhat he is doing. For committing a crime, the intention and act both are taken to be the\\nconstituents of the crime; actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. Every normal and sane\\nhuman being is expected to possess some degree of reason to be responsible for\\nhis/her conduct and acts unless contrary is proved. But a person of unsound mind or a\\nperson suffering from mental disorder cannot be said to possess this basic norm of\\nhuman behaviour.90.\\n[s 84.1] McNaughten Rule and the origin of Section 84 of IPC, 1860.—\\nSection 84 clearly gives statutory recognition to the defence of insanity as developed\\nby the Common Law of England in a decision of the House of Lords rendered in the\\ncase of R v Daniel McNaughten.91. In that case, the House of Lords formulated the\\nfamous Mc Naughten Rules on the basis of the ﬁve questions, which had been referred\\nto them with regard to the defence of insanity. The reference came to be made in a\\ncase where Mc Naughten was charged with the murder by shooting of Edward\\nDrummond, who was the Pvt Secretary of the then Prime Minister of England Sir Robert\\nPeel. The accused Mc Naughten produced medical evidence to prove that, he was not,\\nat the time of committing the act, in a sound state of mind. He claimed that he was\\nsuffering from an insane delusion that the Prime Minister was the only reason for all\\nhis problems. He had also claimed that as a result of the insane delusion, he mistook\\nDrummond for the Prime Minister and committed his murder by shooting him. The plea\\nof insanity was accepted and Mc Naughten was found not guilty, on the ground of\\ninsanity. The aforesaid verdict became the subject of debate in the House of Lords.\\nTherefore, it was determined to take the opinion of all the judges on the law governing\\nsuch cases. Five questions were subsequently put to the Law Lords. A comparison of\\nanswers to question no. 2 and 3 and the provision contained in section 84 of the IPC,\\n1860 would clearly indicate that the section is modelled on that answers.92.\\nThe essential elements of section 84 are as follows:\\n(i)The accused must, at the time of commission of the act be of unsound mind;\\n(ii)The unsoundness must be such as to make the accused at the time when he is\\ndoing the act charged as offence, incapable of knowing the nature of the act or\\nthat he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.93. Where it is proved that the\\naccused has committed multiple murders while suffering from mental\\nderangement of some sort and it is found that there is (i) absence of any motive,\\n(ii) absence of secrecy, (iii) want of pre-arrangement, and (iv) want of\\naccomplices, it would be reasonable to hold that the circumstances are\\nsuﬃcient to support the inference that the accused suffered from unsoundness\\nof mind.94.\\nThough the onus of proving unsoundness of mind is on the accused,95. yet it has been\\nheld that where during the investigation previous history of insanity is revealed, it is the\\nduty of an honest investigator to subject the accused to a medical examination and\\nplace that evidence before the Court and if this is not done, it creates a serious inﬁrmity\\nin the prosecution case and the beneﬁt of doubt has to be given to the accused.96.\\nProsecution is duty bound to subject the accused to a medical examination\\nimmediately.97. This onus may, however, be discharged by producing evidence as to the\\nconduct of the accused shortly prior to the offence and his conduct at the time or', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 254}),\n",

Every person is presumed to know the natural consequences of his act.\\nSimilarly every person is also presumed to know the law. The prosecution has not to\\nestablish these facts.99.\\nThere are four kinds of persons who may be said to be non compos mentis (not of\\nsound mind): (1) an idiot; (2) one made non compos by illness; (3) a lunatic or a\\nmadman; and (4) one who is drunk.\\nAn idiot is one who is of non-sane memory from his birth, by a perpetual inﬁrmity,\\nwithout lucid intervals; and those are said to be idiots who cannot count twenty, or tell\\nthe days of the week, or who do not know their fathers or mothers, or the like. A person\\nmade non compos men-us by illness is excused in criminal cases from such acts as\\nare-committed while under the inﬂuence of his disorder. A lunatic is one who is aﬄicted\\nby mental disorder only at certain periods and vicissitudes, having intervals of reason.\\nMadness is permanent. Lunacy and madness are spoken of as acquired insanity, and\\nidiocy as natural insanity.100.\\n[s 84.2] Legal insanity v i s - a - v i s Medical insanity.—\\nA distinction is to be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A Court is\\nalways concerned with legal insanity, and not with medical insanity. What sections 84,\\nIPC, 1860 provides is defence of legal insanity as distinguished from medical insanity.\\nA person is legally insane when he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that\\nwhat he was doing was wrong or contrary to law.101. Incapacity of the person on\\naccount of insanity must be of the nature which attracts the operation of section 84\\nIPC, 1860.102. An accused who seeks exoneration from liability of an act under section\\n84 of the IPC, 1860 is to prove legal insanity and not medical insanity. Expression\\n\"unsoundness of mind\" has not been deﬁned in the IPC, 1860 and it has mainly been\\ntreated as equivalent to insanity. But the term insanity carries different meaning in\\ndifferent contexts and describes varying degrees of mental disorder. Every person who\\nis suffering from mental disease is not ipso facto exempted from criminal liability. The\\nmere fact that the accused is conceited, odd, irascible and his brain is not quite all\\nright, or that the physical and mental ailments from which he suffered had rendered his\\nintellect weak and affected his emotions or indulges in certain unusual acts, or had ﬁts\\nof insanity at short intervals or that he was subject to epileptic ﬁts and there was\\nabnormal behaviour or the behaviour is queer are not suﬃcient to attract the\\napplication of section 84 of the IPC, 1860.103. The medical profession would\\nundoubtedly treat the accused as a mentally sick person. However, for the purposes of\\nclaiming the beneﬁt of the defence of insanity in law, the appellant would have to prove\\nthat his cognitive faculties were so impaired, at the time when the crime was\\ncommitted, as not to know the nature of the act.104. Only legal insanity is contemplated\\nunder section 84 of IPC, 1860.105.\\n[s 84.3] 42nd Report of Law Commission of India.—\\nLaw Commission of India re-visited section 84 of the IPC, 1860 in view of the criticism\\nto the M\\'Naughten Rules in various countries including Britain but came to the\\nconclusion that law of insanity under section 84 of the IPC, 1860 needs no changes in\\nIndian circumstances.106.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 255}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Section 84 lays down the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged unsoundness of\\nmind. There is no deﬁnition of \"unsoundness of mind\" in the Penal Code. The Courts\\nhave, however, mainly treated this expression as equivalent to insanity. But the term\\n\"insanity\" itself has no precise deﬁnition. It is a term used to describe varying degrees\\nof mental disorder. So, every person, who is mentally diseased, is not ipso facto\\nexempted from criminal responsibility. A distinction is to be made between legal\\ninsanity and medical insanity. A Court is concerned with legal insanity, and not with\\nmedical insanity.107. In this case, the accused was under medical treatment prior to the\\noccurrence. Evidence indicating that he remained mentally ﬁt for about four years after\\ntreatment. During the trial also he was sent for treatment and his conduct was normal\\nthereafter. On such facts, it was held, that the accused was not entitled to protection\\nunder section 84. The Court also added that where previous history of insanity of the\\naccused comes to light during investigation, the accused must be medically examined\\nand report placed before the Court. Any lapse in this respect would create inﬁrmity in\\nthe prosecution case and the accused may become entitled to beneﬁt of doubt.\\n1. \\'At the time of doing it\\'.—It must clearly be proved that at the time of the committing\\nof the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from\\ndisease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if\\nhe did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.108. If he did know it,\\nhe is responsible.109.\\nIn Sheralli Wali Mohammed v State of Maharashtra,110. it was held that:\\n... it must be proved clearly that, at the time of the commission of the acts, the appellant, by\\nreason of unsoundness of mind, was incapable of either knowing the nature of the act or\\nthat the acts were either morally wrong or contrary to law. The question to be asked is, is\\nthere evidence to show that, at the time of the commission of the offence, he was labouring\\nunder any such incapacity? On this question, the state of his mind before and after the\\ncommission of the offence is relevant.\\nThe crucial point of time for deciding whether the beneﬁt of this section should be\\ngiven or not is the material time when the offence takes place. If at that moment a man\\nis found to be labouring under such a defect of reason as not to know the nature of the\\nact he was doing or that, even if he knew it, he did not know it was either wrong or\\ncontrary to law then this section must be applied. In coming to that conclusion, the\\nrelevant circumstances, like the behaviour of the accused before the commission of\\nthe offence and his behaviour after the commission of the offence, should be taken\\ninto consideration.111. The accused pushed a child of four years into ﬁre resulting in his\\ndeath but there was nothing to show that there was any deliberateness or preparation\\nto commit the crime. His act was accompanied by manifestations of unnatural brutality\\nand was committed openly. He neither concealed nor ran away nor tried to avoid\\ndetection which showed that he was not conscious of his guilt. It was held that the\\naccused was entitled to beneﬁt of section 84 and his conviction under section 302 was\\nset aside.112. The accused, a young boy brought up by his grandfather, went abroad for\\nfurther studies. When his parents visited abroad they did not care to see him. His\\ngrandfather\\'s death was communicated to him much later. On return to India, he\\ncommitted offences of brutal nature at random. During the pendency of the session\\'s\\ncase, he again continued and completed his engineering course and started a printing\\npress and later he managed a garage and allied industries employing nearly 30\\npersons. His behaviour before and after the offences was that of a normal man. It was\\nheld that he was insane at the time of the offence and was given beneﬁt of section\\n84.113. Where the accused was examined by two doctors who certiﬁed him to be\\nschizophrenic and his abnormal behaviour was also apparent from the evidence on the\\nrecord, the Supreme Court held that the acquittal of the accused by the High Court was\\nproper.114.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 256}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"In other words, to get the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860, it must be shown that at the\\ntime of the commission of the act the accused by reason of unsoundness of mind was\\nincapable of either knowing the nature of the act or that the act was either morally\\nwrong or contrary to law and for determining this his state of mind before and after the\\ncommission of the offence is most relevant. It would be dangerous to admit the\\ndefence of insanity upon arguments derived merely from the character of the crime.115.\\nThus, the fact that the accused committed the murder over a triﬂing matter and made a\\nclean breast of his crime would not go to show that he was insane.116.\\n[s 84.4] Lucid intervals.—\\nA lucid interval of an insane person is not merely a cessation of the violent symptoms\\nof the disorder, but a restoration of the faculties of the mind suﬃciently to enable the\\nperson soundly to judge the act; but the expression does not necessarily mean\\ncomplete or perfect restoration of the mental faculties to their original condition. So, if\\nthere is such a restoration, the person concerned can do the act with such reason,\\nmemory and judgment as to make it a legal act; merely a cessation of the violent\\nsymptoms of the disorder is not suﬃcient.117.\\n2. 'Unsoundness of mind.'—Whether the want of capacity is temporary or permanent,\\nnatural or supervening, whether it arises from disease, or exists from the time of birth,\\nit is included in this expression. It is only 'unsoundness of mind' which naturally impairs\\nthe cognitive faculties of the mind that can form a ground of exemption from criminal\\nresponsibility.118. The nature and extent of the unsoundness of mind required being\\nsuch as would make the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he\\nis doing what is wrong or contrary to law.119. Thus, as Stephen says that if a person\\ncuts off the head of a sleeping man because 'it would be great fun to see him looking\\nfor it when he woke up', it would obviously be a case where the perpetrator of the act\\nwould be incapable of knowing the physical effects of his act.120. The accused had\\nkilled his wife and his minor children and assaulted his neighbour and the police oﬃcer.\\nThe evidence showed that he had a history of insanity with at random assault on\\nstrangers but his relations with his wife were cordial. It was held that the accused was\\na man of unsound mind and his conviction under sections 302, 332 and 323 was set\\naside.121. The accused caught hold of the legs of a girl of two years of age on the road\\nand struck her on the ground. She sustained head injury and died in the hospital. On the\\nbasis of the ocular evidence about the conduct of the accused at the time of the\\noffence and the opinion of the doctor about his state of mind, the accused was\\nacquitted on the ground of insanity.122. The accused, a labourer, killed his brother's wife\\nand attempted to kill his mother in a quarrel over money deposited with his mother.\\nAccused assaulted with axe on the vital parts of the victim's body, absconded for three\\nmonths and immediately after the incident worked as a labourer in another village for\\n15 days. It was held that the conduct of the accused immediately before, at the time of\\nand after the incident, was wholly inconsistent with the plea of insanity raised by him.\\nThe history of earlier mental derangement was not by itself suﬃcient to bring the case\\nwithin section 84.123. Where on the day of the crime the accused was seen dancing\\nwith a dog on his head and with a broken bottle, but the medical evidence showed that\\nhe was a normal man, it was held that defence of insanity was an afterthought.124. The\\nmere fact that the accused attempted to escape from the scene of occurrence after\\nkilling his wife, belied his plea of insanity.125. Where a father and his relatives sacriﬁced\\na four-year-old son to propitiate the deity, the Supreme Court held that this does not by\\nitself constitute insanity. Such primitive and inhuman actions must be punished\\nseverely so as to deter others from resorting to such barbaric practices.126.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 257}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 84.5] Partial delusion.—\\nMere abnormality of mind or partial delusion affords no protection under section 84\\nIPC, 1860.127. Whether a person who, under an insane delusion as to the existing facts,\\ncommits an offence in consequence thereof, is to be, therefore, excused depends upon\\nthe nature of the delusion. If he labours under a partial delusion only, and is not in other\\nrespects insane, he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if\\nthe facts, with respect to which the delusion exists, were real.128. If a person aﬄicted\\nwith insane delusion, in respect of one or more particular subjects or persons, commits\\na crime, knowing that he was acting contrary to law, but did the act complained of with\\na view, under the inﬂuence of insane delusion, of redressing or revenging some\\nsupposed grievance or injury, or of producing some public beneﬁt, he is nevertheless\\npunishable according to the nature of the crime committed.129. Where the accused\\nafter killing his daughter tried to commit suicide and there was no evidence of\\npsychiatric treatment but only major depression, he was held liable to be convicted.130.\\n3. 'Nature of the act, or...what is either wrong or contrary to law.'—If the accused were\\nconscious that an act was done which he ought not to do and if the act was at the\\nsame time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable. His liability will not be\\ndiminished if he did the act complained of with a view under the inﬂuence of insane\\ndelusion of redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury or of producing\\nsome public beneﬁt, if he knew that he was acting contrary to law.131. Where the\\naccused, a young man, took a girl of four years on a bicycle to a lonely place near a\\ncanal, sexually assaulted her and threw her into the canal, it was held that it was a\\ncarefully thought out action and not an act of an insane person.132.\\nMere absence of motive for a crime, howsoever atrocious it may be, cannot, in the\\nabsence of plea and proof of legal insanity, bring the case within this section.133. The\\nmere fact that an act of murder is committed by the accused on a sudden impulse and\\nthere is no discoverable motive for the act will not generally afford the Court suﬃcient\\nbasis for accepting the plea of insanity.134. Thus, in SW Mohammed's case the\\nSupreme Court held that the mere fact that no motive has been proved why the\\naccused murdered his wife and child or the fact that he made no attempt to run away\\nwhen the door was broken open would not indicate that he was insane or that he did\\nnot have the necessary mens rea for the offence.135. In a Madras case, however, the\\nMadras High Court has held that where the accused was insane for some months prior\\nto occurrence and on cordial terms with his wife but suddenly killed the wife in the\\nopen courtyard without any ostensible motive and did not even attempt to run away or\\nsecret his crime, he had to be given the beneﬁt of section 84, IPC, 1860.136. This case\\ncan, of course, be distinguished from the above mentioned Supreme Court case on the\\nground that in the instant case the accused had previous history of insanity which was\\nnot fully cured. Prior or subsequent treatment for schizophrenia coupled with the\\nevidence of the doctor that the accused was schizophrenic would entitle the accused\\nto the beneﬁt of section 84 in a charge of murder.137. But where the doctor in his\\nevidence merely said unsoundness of mind may have existed from before and that\\nevidence was contradicted by evidence of close relations about sanity of the accused\\nat the time of the occurrence, it was held that the accused could not get the beneﬁt of\\nsection 84, IPC, 1860.138. There is a difference between medical insanity and legal\\ninsanity. By medical insanity is meant the prisoner's consciousness of the bearing of\\nhis act on those affected by it and by legal insanity is meant the prisoner's\\nconsciousness in relation to himself.139. There can be no legal insanity unless the\\ncognitive faculties of the accused are as a result of unsoundness of mind completely\\nimpaired. In order to constitute legal insanity unsoundness of mind must be such as to\\nmake the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what\\nis wrong or contrary to law.140.

Thus, in\\nSiddheswari\\'s case141. where the accused killed her ailing child of three and there was\\nalso some evidence elicited in cross-examination to show that the accused had\\nsuffered from some mental derangement two years prior to the incident, it was held\\nthat the mere fact the murder was committed on a sudden impulse or as a \"mercy\\nkilling\" was no ground to give her the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860, even though both\\neuthanasia (mercy killing) and irresistible impulse would entitle the accused in England\\nto get the beneﬁt of diminished responsibility and her crime would be treated as\\nmanslaughter (i.e. culpable homicide not amounting to murder). In a latter case too the\\nGauhati High Court felt that where the accused has made out a prima facie case of\\nirresistible impulse the plea has to be taken into consideration in deciding the question\\nof giving beneﬁt of section 84, IPC, 1860, to the accused.142.\\nThe position, however, has undergone a sea change in England where the right or\\nwrong test of the M\\'Naughten Rules no longer dominate this branch of criminal law to\\nthe exclusion of mental abnormality falling short of complete insanity as a limited\\ndefence establishing a claim to diminished responsibility. Thus, under section 2 of the\\nHomicide Act, 1957 if two Psychiatrists certify that the homicidal act of the accused\\nwas inﬂuenced by abnormal condition of his mind though not amounting to legal\\ninsanity within the meaning of M\\'Naughten Rules, still he cannot be convicted of\\nmurder but his offence will be regarded only as a manslaughter which is equivalent to\\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder under the IPC, 1860. It is hoped that the\\nIndian law too would be changed on this score with due regard to the modern\\ndevelopments in the ﬁeld of psychology of criminal behaviour.\\n[s 84.6] CASES.—\\nAccused, who was a mentally challenged person before the incident, killed three\\npersons and caused injuries to others with an axe. He did not know the implication of\\nhis act and indiscriminately went on wielding axe blows, be it a child or a woman and\\nthere after he did not even attempt to hide the weapon which he used for committing\\ncrime. He was found of unsound mind in his medical examination. Case of accused\\ncomes within the four corners of section 84 IPC, 1860.143. Where an accused, who was\\nsuffering from fever which caused him while suffering from its paroxysms to be\\nbewildered and unconscious, killed his children at being annoyed at their crying, but he\\nwas not delirious then, and there was no evidence to show that he was not conscious\\nof the nature of his act, it was held that he was not entitled to protection under this\\nsection.144. But where the accused labouring under a delusion believed his two-month-\\nold infant child to be a devil and danger to himself, his family and to the whole world\\nand, therefore, killed the child with unusual ferocity almost reducing it to a pulp and\\nthereafter without making any attempt to escape told the police party that he had\\nremoved a devil from the world, it was held that the accused did not know that what he\\nhad done was wrong and as such was entitled to get protection of section 84, IPC,\\n1860, even when he did not plead insanity in his defence as the prosecution itself\\ndisclosed that he was insane.145.

Though\\nthis, by itself, would not be suﬃcient to come to any conclusion but taken along with\\nthe other circumstances of the case would clearly point to the validity of the defence\\nput forward on behalf of the accused.148.\\n[s 84.7] Epilepsy, Epileptic ﬁts and Section 84.—\\nEpilepsy usually occurs from early infancy, though it may occur at any period of life.\\nIndividuals, who have had epileptic ﬁts for years, do not necessarily show any mental\\naberration, but quite a few of them suffer from mental deterioration. Religiosity is a\\nmarked feature in the commencement, but the feeling is only superﬁcial. Such patients\\nare peevish, impulsive and suspicious, and are easily provoked to anger on the slightest\\ncause. Epileptic psychosis is that which is associated with epileptic ﬁts. This may\\noccur before or after the ﬁts, or may replace them, and is known as pre- epileptic, post-\\nepileptic and masked or psychic phases (psychomotor epilepsy).149.\\nWhere the accused committed the murder without any motive under the inﬂuence of an\\nepileptic ﬁts, he was entitled to get the beneﬁt under section 84, IPC, 1860.150.

The provisions of section 84 are in substance the same as those laid down in\\nthe answers of the Judges to the questions put to them by the House of Lords, in\\nM'Naughten's case.

The enquiry report and evidence of family members and other witnesses\\nrevealed the addiction and on-going treatment. He was not allowed the beneﬁt of\\nsection 84. The state of mind on the day of the incident is the crucial factor. The State\\nof mind on other days is relevant only if such evidence would help determining the\\nstate of mind at the crucial moment.154.\\n[s 84.11] Insane delusion.—\\nThe accused killed two women by cutting their necks with an axe without any reason.\\nEvidence showed that he suffered from similar attacks of disorder earlier too. After the\\nincident he was heard saying that he was haunted by a God to do what he did. The plea\\nof insanity was accepted and the accused was directed to be kept in a mental\\nhospital.155. The accused killed seven persons including his wife and two children with\\nan axe. He also killed the cattle which came his way. There was no provocation. It was\\nbrutality simpliciter. The evidence on record showed that he was not of sound mind.\\nThe death sentence awarded to him was set aside. He was acquitted under the beneﬁt\\nof this section.156.

Suspiciousness is the characteristic symptom of the early stage.\\nIdeas of reference occur, which gradually develop into delusions of persecution.\\nAuditory hallucinations follow which in the beginning, start as sounds or noises in the\\nears, but afterwards change into abuses or insults.158. In paranoid schizophrenia, the\\nperson affected lives in a state of constant fear being haunted by the belief that he is\\nbeing poisoned, some noxious gases are blown into his room and that all are plotting\\nagainst him to ruin him. The patient gets very irritated and excited owing to equally\\npainful and disagreeable hallucinations and delusions.159. The accused was convicted\\nfor having murdered his wife in a brutal manner. He raised the plea of insanity. It came\\nout from evidence that he was suffering from leprosy and insanity from sometime past.\\nThe medical opinion was that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which is a\\nform of paranoid psychosis.

The evidence on record shows that\\non the day of the incident, when the appellant was examined by doctors, he was found\\nto be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He had delusions and persecutory ideas\\nwith no insight in his illness. From this, an inference can reasonably be drawn that the\\naccused was under paranoid delusions at the time that he committed the offence.161.\\n[s 84.13] Burden of proof.—\\nThe Supreme Court deﬁned the doctrine of burden of proof in the context of the plea of\\ninsanity in the following propositions:-', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 261}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='\"(1)The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had\\ncommitted the offence with the requisite mens rea; and the burden of proving\\nthat always rests on the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial.\\n(2)There is a rebuttable presumption that the appellant was not insane, when he\\ncommitted the crime, in the sense laid down by section 84 of the IPC, 1860: the\\nappellant may rebut it by placing before the court all the relevant evidence - oral,\\ndocumentary or circumstantial, but the burden of proof upon him is no higher\\nthan that rests upon a party to civil proceedings.\\n(3)Even if the appellant was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane\\nat the time he committed the offence, the evidence placed before the court by\\nthe appellant or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of\\nthe court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including\\nmens rea of the appellant and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit\\nthe appellant on the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the\\nprosecution was not discharged\".162.\\nIt has been held that merely because an injured witness, who may legitimately be\\nclassiﬁed as an interested witness for obvious reasons, may have stated that the\\nappellant was not of unsound mind, cannot absolve the primary duty of the prosecution\\nto establish its case beyond all reasonable doubt explaining why the plea for\\nunsoundness of mind taken by the accused was untenable.163.\\nThe burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the\\npurview of section 84 lies upon the accused under section 105 of the Indian Evidence\\nAct. Under the said section, the Court shall presume the absence of such\\ncircumstances.164. But the burden on the accused cannot be equivalent with the\\nburden of proof on the prosecution and cannot be rated higher than the burden on a\\nparty to a civil proceeding where a ﬁnding can be based upon preponderance of\\nprobabilities. There is no conﬂict between the general burden which is always on the\\nprosecution and which never shifts and the special burden which rests on the accused\\nto make out the defence of insanity.165. Sometimes the facts may in themselves be\\nsuﬃcient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused. This possibility was\\nrecognised by the Supreme Court in Ratan Lal v State of MP.166. The accused-appellant\\nwas kept in police custody for ten days and only then it was felt that he needed medical\\nexamination. There was no evidence on record to show what his condition was during\\nthose ten days and why he was not examined earlier. This conduct on the part of the\\npolice, neither to arrange his examination nor permit him to do so, brought about such\\na gap of time between the incident and examination that his condition at the time of\\nthe incident was no longer capable of being precisely determined. As against this\\npolice inaction, the defence pointed towards the conduct of the accused before the\\nincident and some statements of witnesses which supported the instable condition of\\nthe accused. This was held to be suﬃcient to discharge the burden which lies on the\\naccused and his acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court. Going by this case in\\nTukappa Tamanna Lingardi v State of Maharashtra,167. the Bombay High Court found\\nevidence of insanity from a narration of the facts themselves. Mere oral statements of\\nwitnesses cannot give rise to an inference that the appellant was of unsound mind at\\nthe time of commission of offence. Plea of the accused does not come within\\nexception contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.168. IPC, 1860\\nWhere there was no satisfactory evidence of the previous history of the accused or his\\nsubsequent conduct and the only fact on record was that ghastly murders were\\ncommitted without motive, it was held that the burden of proof as to plea of insanity\\nwas not discharged. However, because of the absence of motive, premeditation and\\nany weapon, killings being done with stone pieces, death sentence was converted into\\nlife imprisonment.169.

The accused, therefore, could not be detained in prison. He\\nwas directed to be put in a mental hospital. The authorities were further directed to\\nfollow the procedure prescribed by section 335, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr\\nPC, 1973).173.\\n[s 84.15] Sentencing.—Battered woman syndrome.—\\nThe accused woman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on an indictment for murder. She\\nwas a young woman aged 20. She began a sexual relationship with the deceased when\\nshe was 14 and began to live with him when she was 16. She had a miscarriage and on\\ntwo occasions took overdoses. The deceased became violent towards her two or three\\ntimes each week. She sought psychiatric help and on two occasions came to the\\nattention of the police. In 1998 she decided to end the relationship and there was an\\nargument which developed into a ﬁght. She picked up a knife and waved it at the\\ndeceased, telling him to leave. There was a further struggle during the course of which\\nthe deceased received a fatal knife wound to his back. She immediately shouted for\\nhelp and was found in an extremely distressed condition. When she was examined, she\\nwas found to be extensively bruised. A psychiatrist who examined her found that she\\nexhibited a number of features of the \"battered woman\\'s syndrome\", including chronic\\ndepressive illness, a feeling of hopelessness and despair, and inability to act effectively\\nor to see an escape from her situation, and feelings of self-blame, shame and a poor\\nsense of self-worth. A second psychiatrist found a degree of clinical depression which\\namounted to abnormality of mind. She was sentenced to four years\\' detention in a\\nyoung offender institution. Her appeal against the sentence was allowed. In the light of\\nthe evidence, the Court reached the conclusion that there were in the present case\\nthose exceptional circumstances which would allow the Court to take the unusual\\ncourse of passing a sentence other than custody. The accused woman had been\\nsubject from a young age to persistent and prolonged violence from a man older than\\nherself who was domineering and demanding. Since her arrest she had made\\nremarkable progress, and a custodial sentence would be likely to damage and possibly\\nbring to an end that rehabilitation. She had served the equivalent of a sentence of 12\\nmonths and it was appropriate to give her the opportunity to continue her progress. The\\nCourt accordingly quashed the sentence of four years\\' detention in a young offender\\ninstitution and substituted a probation order.174.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 263}),\n",

The Division Bench of\\nHigh Court of Kerala observed that even if all the acts constituting an offence as per\\ndeﬁnition in IPC, 1860 are committed by a person, if an investigating oﬃcer ﬁnds on\\ninvestigation that by reason of unsoundness of mind, accused was incapable of\\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what is either wrong or contrary to\\nlaw, as stated in Section 84 IPC, 1860, he shall not ﬁle a charge sheet against such\\nperson.181.

A person\\ncannot become himself drunk with liquor and commit an offence and then come and\\nsay that he had consumed the liquor and, therefore, the beneﬁt of section 85 should be\\ngiven to him.187. The law pronounces that the obscuration and divestment of that\\njudgment and human feeling which in a sober state would have prevented the accused\\nfrom offending, shall not, when produced by his voluntary act, screen him from\\npunishment, although he be no longer capable of self-restraint.188. It is also no excuse\\nto say that because of it he failed to resist the impulse to act in a certain way189. or\\nthat because of it he acted like an automaton.190.\\n[s 85.1] Voluntary drunkenness.—when an excuse.—\\nNevertheless voluntary drunkenness is a factor which has to be taken into\\nconsideration at least in two types of cases, viz.,\\n(i) where a speciﬁc intent is an essential element of an offence charged and the\\nevidence shows that the state of intoxication of the accused is such that he is\\nincapable of forming the speciﬁc intent essential to constitute the crime.191. In the\\nIndian context, for example, it would be intent to kill as in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section\\n300, IPC, 1860. In such cases, however, even if the accused fails to actually form the\\nspeciﬁc intent, section 86, IPC, 1860, would impute the necessary guilty knowledge to\\nhim and he would, therefore, be liable for culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\nthough not of murder.192. Thus, voluntary intoxication amounting to prove incapacity to\\nform the required speciﬁc intent would be a limited excuse to reduce an offence of\\nmurder (section 302) to one of culpable homicide not amounting murder (section 304,\\nIPC, 1860). This is, however, a question of fact in each case.\\nIn a case of wife-burning, her dying declaration disclosed that her husband consumed\\nliquor, scolded her and then set her aﬁre after pouring kerosene on her. She fought the\\nﬁre and tried to run away but the accused again caught hold of her and again poured oil\\nand inﬂamed her. It was held that these circumstances showed that the mental\\nfaculties of the accused were not impaired to such an extent that he was prevented\\nfrom forming the requisite intention to cause death. He was convicted under section\\n302 and not section 304, Part II.193.\\n(ii) where habitual drunkenness has resulted in such a diseased condition of the mind\\nthat the accused is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what\\nis either wrong or contrary to law.

It was held that\\ndrunkenness was no defence unless it could be established that the accused at the\\ntime of committing rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent to\\ncommit it (which was not alleged), inasmuch as the death resulted from a succession\\nof acts, the rape and the act of violence causing suffocation, which could not be\\nregarded independently of each other; and that the accused was guilty of murder.197.\\nDrink is an aggravating feature in the award of sentence. In reference to one of the\\naccused persons there was no evidence to establish that the effect of intoxication was\\nsuch as to cause him to lack the speciﬁc intent for murder, particularly in view of the\\nfact that, on his own admission, he was following instructions given by the other\\naccused and he was able to give the police a lucid account of his actions.

       " Document(page_content='intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without\\nhis knowledge or against his will.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nOffence requiring particular intent or knowledge.—By reading the above section, it is\\nclear that in the ﬁrst part of the section the words \\'intention or knowledge\\' are\\nmentioned, but in the latter part of the section the word \\'knowledge\\' is only mentioned\\nand the word \\'intention\\' is omitted. In case of voluntary drunkenness, knowledge is to\\nbe presumed in the same manner as if there was no drunkenness. If really the\\nParliament wanted the word \\'intention\\' also to be presumed even in the case of an act\\ndone in a drunken state of mind, the said word could have been mentioned in the\\nSecond part also, but the same is omitted. Therefore, whether the accused was having\\nintention or not while committing an act cannot be presumed as in case of\\nknowledge.199. As certain guilty knowledge or intention forms part of the deﬁnition of\\nmany offences, this section is provided to meet those cases. It says that a person\\nvoluntarily intoxicated will be deemed to have the same knowledge as he would have\\nhad if he had not been intoxicated. There may be cases in which a particular knowledge\\nis an ingredient, and there may be other cases in which a particular intent is an\\ningredient, the two not being necessarily always identical. The section does not say\\nthat the accused shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same intention as\\nmight have been presumed if he had not been intoxicated. Therefore, although there is\\na presumption so far as knowledge is concerned, there is no such presumption with\\nregard to intention.200. Thus, this section attributes to a drunken man the knowledge of\\na sober man when judging of his action but does not give him the same intention. This\\nknowledge is the result of a legal ﬁction and constructive intention cannot invariably be\\nraised.201. Drunkenness makes no difference to the knowledge with which a man is\\ncredited and if a man knew what the natural consequences of his acts were, he must\\nbe presumed to have intended to cause them.202. But this presumption may be\\nrebutted by his showing that at the time he did the act, his mind was so affected by the\\ndrink he had taken that he was incapable of forming the intention requisite for making\\nhis act the offence charged against him.203.\\nSo far as knowledge is concerned the Court must attribute to the intoxicated man the\\nsame knowledge as if he was quite sober but so far as intent or intention is concerned,\\nthe Court must gather it from the attending general circumstances of the case paying\\ndue regard to the degree of intoxication. If the man was beside his mind altogether for\\nthe time being, it would not be possible to ﬁx him with the requisite intention. In other\\nwords, where a man goes so deep into drinking that he becomes really incapable of\\nforming the requisite speciﬁc intent or knowledge for the offence, then in such a case\\ntoo section 86 of the Code would impute the requisite knowledge to the accused\\nthough not the requisite intention. Thus, where the accused in a state of extreme\\nintoxication caused a fatal injury in the abdomen of his friend but by virtue of his highly\\nintoxicated state of mind was incapable of knowing then as to what he was doing far\\nless forming the requisite intent to kill as envisaged in section 300, IPC, 1860, he could\\nnot be convicted under section 302 as he did not have the requisite intent to kill but he\\ncould still be convicted under section 304 Part II, IPC, 1860, by virtue of imputed\\nknowledge under section 86, IPC, 1860.204. In this connection see also the discussion\\nunder sub-head \"voluntary drunkenness: when an excuse\" under section 85, ante. But if\\nhe had not gone so deep in drinking and from the facts it could be found that he knew\\nwhat he was about the Court will apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the\\nnatural consequences of his act or acts.205.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 277}),\n",

A K Chaudhary v State of Gujarat, 2006 Cr LJ 726 (Guj).[s 86.1] CASES.—\\nAccused husband beating his wife and throwing burning lamp on her under inﬂuence of\\nliquor. Since he himself consumed the liquor he is not entitled to claim beneﬁt under\\nsection 86 of IPC, 1860.206. Act of the accused of walking a distance to the house of a\\nwitness and concealing the weapon and his wearing apparels showed that he was\\nconscious and capable of understanding of his act. No evidence as regards the degree\\nof intoxication or any evidence of any attending general circumstances to arrive at a\\nconclusion that accused was beside his mind altogether temporarily at time\\nincident.207. On the basis of evidence in this case, it cannot be said that the accused\\nwas so much intoxicated at the time of the incident that he was beside his mind\\naltogether for the time being. He did set his wife on ﬁre, but as soon as her sari started\\nburning he realised the folly of his act and started extinguishing the ﬁre. It shows that\\nhe was not so much intoxicated that he was besides his mind altogether. Therefore, the\\nrule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act can be\\napplied to him also. Conviction under section 302 IPC, 1860 altered to one under\\nsection 304(1) IPC, 1860.208.\\n[s 86.2] Sections 85 and 86.—\\nThe reading of sections 85 and 86 together makes it clear that section 86 is an\\nexception to section 85. These provisions show that if the intoxication is induced\\nvoluntarily, the act done is an offence even if the person is incapable of knowing the\\nnature of the act or that what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law. This section\\nobviously covers all offences. That is why; it appears that it became necessary to enact\\nsection 86 to take care of offences requiring a particular intent or knowledge on the\\npart of the intoxicated offender. The section takes care of such offences and states\\nthat if intoxication is involuntary, neither knowledge nor intention in committing the\\noffence will be presumed. If however, it is voluntary only knowledge of the offence on\\nthe part of the offender will be presumed but not intention in committing it. What\\nsection 86 means and no more as compared to section 85. The degree of intoxication\\ndemanded by both sections, however, remains the same. In fact, it is instructive to note\\nthat section 84 which exempts persons of unsoundness of mind also expects the\\ndegree of unsoundness to the same extent, viz., incapability of knowing the nature of\\nthe act or of the knowledge that what is being done either wrong or contrary to law.\\nHence, the conclusion is inescapable that to avail of the exception under section 86,\\nthe degree of intoxication of the offender must be such that he is incapable of knowing\\nthe nature of the act or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.\\nIntoxication short of this degree will not entitle the offender to the beneﬁt of the\\nexception.209.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 278}),\n",

This agreement implies the\\nconsent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be\\ncaused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nConsent.—This section protects a person who causes injury to another person above\\n18 years of age who has given his consent by doing an act not intended and not known\\nto be likely to cause death or grievous hurt. It appears to proceed upon the maxim\\nvolenti non ﬁt injuria. He who consents suffers no injury. This rule is founded upon two\\nvery simple propositions: (1) that every person is the best judge of his own interest and\\n(2) that no man will consent to what he thinks hurtful to himself. Every man is free to\\ninﬂict any suffering or damage he chooses on his own person and property; and if,\\ninstead of doing this himself, he consents to its being done by another, the doer\\ncommits no offence. A man may give away his property, and so another who takes it by\\nhis permission does not commit theft. He may inﬂict self-torture or he may consent to\\nsuffer torture at the hands of another.\\nThe section does not permit a man to give his consent to anything intended, or known\\nto be likely to cause his own death or grievous hurt.\\n[s 87.1] Sado-masochistic desires.—\\nIn the absence of a good reason, the victim's consent is no defence and the\\nsatisfaction of sado-masochistic desires does not constitute such a good reason. A\\ngroup of sado-masochistics participated in consensual acts of violence against each\\nother for sexual gratiﬁcation. They were charged with various offences. They were\\nconvicted for causing harm to one member. It is not in public interest that a person\\nshould wound or cause actual bodily harm to another for no good reason and without\\nsuch a reason the victim's consent afforded no defence.210.\\n[s 87.2] Injection of heroin on request resulting in death.—\\nThe accused appealed against a sentence of ﬁve years' imprisonment for\\nmanslaughter. The deceased, visited him, at his ﬂat. He had previously drunk a\\nsigniﬁcant quantity of alcohol. He took some heroin and demanded more. At his\\nrequest the accused injected him with more heroin, resulting in his death. The accused\\ncontended that weight should have been given to his admission of responsibility and\\nhis guilty plea, the fact that the deceased had insisted upon more heroin, that there was\\nno commercial motive involved in the supply and that he had co-operated in naming the\\nsupplier of the heroin.\\nIt was held that it was necessary to take into consideration accused's co-operation in\\nnaming the supplier of the heroin and other mitigating factors. The sentence for\\nmanslaughter was reduced to three years' imprisonment and the sentence for\\nsupplying a Class A drug, from three years' imprisonment to two years.211.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 282}),\n",

A has committed\\nno offence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nThe preceding section allows any harm to be inﬂicted short of death or grievous hurt.\\nThis section sanctions the inﬂiction of any harm if it is for the beneﬁt of the person to\\nwhom it is caused. No consent can justify an intentional causing of death. But a person\\nfor whose beneﬁt a thing is done may consent that another shall do that thing, even if\\ndeath may probably ensue. If a person gives his free and intelligent consent to take the\\nrisk of an operation which, in a large proportion of cases, has proved fatal, the surgeon\\nwho operates cannot be punished even if death ensues.213. Again; if a person attacked\\nby a wild beast should call out to his friends to ﬁre, though with imminent hazard to\\nhimself, and they were to obey the call, we do not conceive that it would be expedient\\nto punish them, though they might by ﬁring cause his death, and though when they ﬁred\\nthey knew themselves to be likely to cause his death.214.\\nThis section differs from the last section in two particulars—(1) under it any harm\\nexcept death may be inﬂicted; (2) the age of the person consenting is not mentioned\\n(but see section 90 under which the age of the consenting party must at least be 12\\nyears).\\nPersons not qualiﬁed as medical practitioners cannot claim the beneﬁt of this section\\nas they can hardly be deemed to act in 'good faith' as that expression is deﬁned in\\nsection 52.215.\\n[s 88.1] Criminal liability on doctor or surgeon.—\\nProsecution has to come out with a case of high degree of negligence on part of\\ndoctor. Thus, when a patient agrees to go for medical treatment or surgical operation,\\nevery careless act of the medical man cannot be termed as 'criminal.' It can be termed\\n'criminal' only when the medical man exhibits a gross lack of competence or inaction\\nand wanton indifference to his patient's safety and which is found to have arisen from\\ngross ignorance or gross negligence. Where a patient's death results merely from error\\nof judgment or an accident, no criminal liability should be attached to it. Mere\\ninadvertence or some degree of want of adequate care and caution might create civil\\nliability but would not suﬃce to hold him criminally liable.216. Even if the surgery was\\ndone without the consent of the patient or his/her guardian, if it is for the beneﬁt of the\\npatient he is not liable. Section 98 deals with harm caused with the consent of the\\nperson injured or someone competent under law to give such consent on his behalf\\nexcludes causing of such harm from the category of offence. Here the complainant has\\ngiven her consent. Section 88 IPC, 1860 provides that harm done for the beneﬁt of the\\nperson injured and with his consent will not make the person causing harm liable for\\ncriminal offence.217.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 286}),\n",

To deny that authority would amount to a denial of all that is desirable and\\nnecessary for the welfare, discipline and education of the pupil concerned. It can therefore\\nbe assumed that when a parent entrusted a child to a teacher, he on his behalf impliedly\\nconsents for the teacher to exercise over the pupil such authority. Of course, the person of\\nthe pupil is certainly protected by the penal provisions of the Indian Penal Code. But the\\nsame code has recognised exceptions in the form of ss. 88 and 89. Where a teacher\\nexceeds the authority and inﬂicts such harm to the pupil as may be considered to be\\nunreasonable and immoderate, he would naturally lose the beneﬁt of the exceptions.\\nWhether he is entitled to the beneﬁt of the exceptions or not in a given case will depend\\nupon the particular nature, extent and severity of the punishment inﬂicted.\\n220.In K A Abdul Vahid v State of Kerala,221. the Kerala High Court considered the\\nquestion when a school teacher, beats a student with a cane, who created commotion\\nin the school or showed disobedience to the Rules, whether he could be proceeded\\nagainst under the provisions of the IPC, 1860 and found that the teacher has acted\\nwithin the exception conferred on him, under section 88 of IPC, 1860.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 291}),\n",

If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860.

This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC,\\n1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, deﬁnition of every offence is to be\\nunderstood subject to the \"General Exceptions\".

Consent means an active will in the mind\\nof a person to permit the doing of the act complained of, and knowledge of what is to\\nbe done, or of the nature of the act that is being done, is essential to consent to an\\nact.223. An act of helplessness on the face of inevitable compulsions is not consent in\\nlaw.224. It requires voluntary participation by victim not only after exercise of\\nintelligence based on knowledge of signiﬁcance and moral quality of act, but after\\nhaving fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent.225. A mere act of\\nhelpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, non-resistance and passive\\ngiving in cannot be deemed to be consent.226. The Supreme Court in a long line of\\ncases has given wider meaning to the word 'consent' in the context of sexual offences\\nas explained in various judicial dictionaries. In Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law\\n(Second Edn), vol (1) 1977 at p 422 the word 'consent' has been explained as an act of\\nreason accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good or\\nevil on either side. It is further stated that consent supposes three things–a physical\\npower, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained\\nby intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue\\ninﬂuence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the\\nmind.227. Section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive deﬁnition of consent for\\nthe purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not\\nintended to be excluded.228. For determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix\\nwas voluntary or under a misconception of fact, no straitjacket formula can be laid\\ndown.229.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 294}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The factors set out in the ﬁrst part are from the point of view of the victim. The second\\npart enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It\\nenvisages that the accused too has the knowledge or reason to believe that the\\nconsent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of\\nfact. The requirements of both the parts have to be cumulatively satisﬁed.230.\\nSubmission of the body under the fear of terror cannot be construed as a consented\\nsexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not\\nonly after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the signiﬁcance and\\nmoral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance\\nand assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful\\nstudy of all relevant circumstances.231. Consent can be obtained under various\\nmethods and always necessarily need not be a one which is given voluntarily. For\\nexample, if a victim is intoxicated without her knowledge or consent and if the rape is\\ncommitted while the victim was intoxicated or drunken, it cannot be said that she had\\nvoluntarily given the consent. Therefore, such passive consent cannot be treated as a\\nconsent as contemplated by section 90 of IPC, 1860.232. Obtaining consent by\\nexercising deceit cannot be legitimate defence to exculpate an accused.233.\\n[s 90.1] Submission to Rape.—\\nAn act of submission does not involve consent- Consent cannot be equated to inability\\nto resist or helplessness.234. Every consent involves a submission, but every\\nsubmission is not consent and the mere fact that a woman had submitted to the\\npromise of the accused does not necessarily indicate that her consent existed unless\\nthe evidence on record establishes that the sexual act, which the prosecutrix had\\nallowed, was accompanied with deliberation after the mind had weighed, as in a\\nbalance, the good and the evil on each side with the existing capacity and power to\\nwithdraw the assent according to one\\'s will or pleasure.235. Where, the accused had\\nsexual intercourse with the prosecutrix by giving false assurance to her that he would\\nmarry her and when she became pregnant, he refused to do so, it was evident that he\\nnever intended to marry her and procured her consent only for the reason of having\\nsexual relations with her, therefore, the act of the accused fell squarely under the\\ndeﬁnition of rape as her consent was obtained under a misconception of fact.236.\\n1. \\'Misconception of fact\\'.—The expression \"under a misconception of fact\" is broad\\nenough to include all cases where the consent is obtained by misrepresentation; the\\nmisrepresentation should be regarded as leading to a misconception of the facts with\\nreference to which the consent is given. In section 3 of the Evidence Act Illustration (d)\\nstates that a person has a certain intention is treated as a fact. So, here the fact about\\nwhich the second and third prosecution witnesses were made to entertain a\\nmisconception was the fact that the second accused intended to get the girl married...\\n\"thus... if the consent of the person from whose possession the girl is taken is obtained\\nby fraud, the taking is deemed to be against the will of such a person…\" Although in\\ncases of contracts a consent obtained by coercion or fraud is only voidable by the party\\naffected by it, the effect of section 90 IPC, 1860 is that such consent cannot, under the\\ncriminal law, be availed of to justify what would otherwise be an offence.237. Consent\\nmay be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or through deceit.\\nConsent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a\\nbalance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between rape and\\nconsensual sex and in a case like this, the Court must very carefully examine whether\\nthe accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala ﬁde motives, and had\\nmade a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the\\nambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a\\npromise, and not fulﬁlling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there\\nwas made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether\\nthe consent involved was given after wholly, understanding the nature and', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 295}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='consequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees\\nto have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not\\nsolely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an\\naccused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were\\nbeyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so.\\nSuch cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if\\nthe Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala ﬁde, and\\nthat he had clandestine motives.238. In order to come within the meaning of\\nmisconception of fact, the fact must have an immediate relevance. If a fully grown-up\\ngirl consents to the act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage and continues\\nto indulge in such activity until she becomes pregnant, it is an act of promiscuity on her\\npart and not an act induced by misconception of fact and it was held that section 90\\nIPC, 1860 cannot be invoked unless the Court can be assured that from the inception\\nthe accused never intended to marry her. Therefore, it depends on case to case that\\nwhat is the evidence led in the matter. If it is a fully grown-up girl who gave the consent\\nthen it is a different case but a girl whose age is very tender and she is giving a consent\\nafter persuasion of three months on the promise that the accused will marry her which\\nhe never intended to fulﬁl right from the beginning which is apparent from the conduct\\nof the accused, in our opinion, section 90 can be invoked.239. A promise to marry\\nwithout anything more will not give rise to \"misconception of fact\" within the meaning\\nof section 90, it needs to be clariﬁed that a representation deliberately made by the\\naccused with a view to elicit the assent of the victim without having the intention or\\ninclination to marry her, will vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is established that at\\nthe very inception of the making of promise, the accused did not really entertain the\\nintention of marrying her and the promise to marry held out by him was a mere hoax,\\nthe consent ostensibly given by the victim will be of no avail to the accused to\\nexculpate him from the ambit of section 375 clause second.240.\\n[s 90.2] CASES.—\\nThe prosecutrix had sexual intercourse with the accused on the representation made\\nby the accused that he would marry her. This was a false promise held out by the\\naccused. Had this promise not been given perhaps, she would not have permitted the\\naccused to have sexual intercourse. It appears that the intention of the accused was,\\nright from the beginning, not honest and he kept on promising that he will marry her, till\\nshe became pregnant. This kind of consent obtained by the accused cannot be said to\\nbe any consent because she was under a misconception of fact that the accused\\nintends to marry her, therefore, she had submitted to sexual intercourse with him.241. In\\nUday v State of Karnataka,242. the Court considered the following facts: (i) where a girl\\nwas of 19 years of age and had suﬃcient intelligence to understand the signiﬁcance\\nand moral quality of the act she was consenting to; (ii) she was conscious of the fact\\nthat her marriage was diﬃcult on account of caste considerations; (iii) it was diﬃcult to\\nimpute to the appellant, knowledge that the prosecutrix had consented in consequence\\nof a misconception of the fact arising from his promise; and (iv) there was no evidence\\nto prove conclusively that the appellant never intended to marry the prosecutrix. On the\\nbasis of the above factors, Court held that it did not feel persuaded to hold that consent\\nwas obtained by misconception of facts on the part of the victim.\\nIn a case, the prosecutrix had left her home voluntarily, of her own free will to get\\nmarried to the accused. She was 19 years of age at the relevant time and was, hence,\\ncapable of understanding the complications and issues surrounding her marriage to\\nthe appellant. According to the version of events provided by her, the prosecutrix had\\ncalled the accused on a number given to her by him, to ask him why he had not met her\\nat the place that had been pre-decided by them.

The Works of Lord Macaulay- 'On the Chapter of General Exceptions', Note B.There yet remains a kindred class of cases which are by no means of rare occurrence. For\\nexample, a person falls down in an apoplectic ﬁt. Bleeding alone can save him, and he is\\nunable to signify his consent to be bled. The surgeon who bleeds him commits an act falling\\nunder the deﬁnition of an offence. The surgeon is not the patient's guardian, and has no\\nauthority from any such guardian, yet it is evident that the surgeon ought not to be\\npunished. Again, a house is on ﬁre. A person snatches up a child too young to understand\\nthe danger, and ﬂings it from the house-top, with a faint hope that it may be caught on a\\nblanket below, but with the knowledge that it is highly probable that it will be dashed to\\npieces. Here, though the child may be killed by the fall though the person who threw it down\\nknew that it would very probably be killed, and though he was not the child's parent or\\nguardian, he ought not to be punished.\\nIn these examples there is what may be called a temporary guardianship justiﬁed by the\\nexigency of the case and by the humanity of the motive. This temporary guardianship bears\\na considerable analogy to that temporary magistracy with which the law invests every\\nperson who is present when a great crime is committed, or when the public peace is\\nconcerned. To acts done in the exercise of this temporary guardianship, we extend by\\nclause 72 a protection very similar to that which we have given to the acts of regular\\nguardians.244.\\nThis section speaks of 'hurt', whereas section 89 speaks of 'grievous hurt', otherwise\\nthe terminology of both the sections is almost identical.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 305}),\n",

The authors of the Code observe:\\nClause 73 [this section] is intended to provide for those cases which, though, from the\\nimperfections of language, fall within the letter of the penal law, are yet not within its spirit,\\nand are all over the world considered by the public, and for the most part dealt with by the\\ntribunals, as innocent. As our deﬁnitions are framed, it is theft to dip a pen in another man's\\nink, mischief to crumble one of his wafers, an assault to cover him with a cloud of dust by\\nriding past him, hurt to incommode him by pressing against him in getting into a carriage.\\nThere are innumerable acts without performing which men cannot live together in society,\\nacts which all men constantly do and suffer in turn, and which it is desirable that they\\nshould do and suffer in turn, yet which differ only in degree from crimes. That these acts\\nought not to be treated as crimes is evident, and we think it far better expressly to except\\nthem from the penal clauses of the Code than to leave it to the judges to except them in\\npractice.253.\\nThe expression 'harm' has been used in this section in a wide sense including physical\\ninjury and hence, this section applies in cases of actual physical injury also. This\\nsection applies not only to acts which are accidental but also to deliberate acts which\\ncause harm or are intended to cause harm or known to be likely to cause harm.254. In a\\ncampaign by Sarvodaya workers to educate people about the evil of alcohol, liquor\\nshops were picketed to prevent people from going there even if it was at the cost of\\nslight harm; their prosecution under section 341 for causing wrongful restraint was\\nquashed.255. Where the accused locked the complainant inside the factory by pulling\\ndown the shutter, it was held that ingredients of the offence under section 342\\n(wrongful conﬁnement) were established but as the complainant regained his freedom\\nwithin a very short time and only a minimal harm was caused, the case was clearly\\ncovered by section 95.256.\\n[s 95.1] CASES.—Acts regarded as trivial.—\\nThis section was applied where a person was convicted for taking pods, almost\\nvalueless, from a tree standing on Government waste land;257. where the accused\\ncommitted theft of a cheque of no value258. and where the plaintiff complained of the\\nharm caused to his reputation by the imputation that he was travelling with a wrong\\nticket.259. So also an offence of misbranding260. and the conduct of a lawyer in using\\nﬁlthy language in course of cross-examination261. were treated as trivial.\\nWhere the record of the trial Court showed that the injury caused was very simple,\\nbeing in the nature of a scratch, the Court said that the act was so trivial that no person\\nof a sound common sense would regard it as an offence. The prayer of the\\ncomplainant for conviction of the accused for causing simple hurt under section 323\\nwas liable to be rejected.262.\\n[s 95.2] Acts not regarded as trivial.—\\nThe top most oﬃcial of the State Police, indecently behaved with a senior lady IAS\\nOﬃcer, in the presence of gentry and in spite of her raising objections continued with\\nsuch behaviour. The Supreme Court observed that if it is held, on the face of such\\nallegations that, the ignominy and trauma to which, she was subjected to was so slight\\nthat the lady IAS Oﬃcer, as a person of ordinary sense and temper, would not complain\\nabout the same, sagacity will be the ﬁrst casualty.

When enacting sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, 1860, excepting from its penal\\nprovisions, certain classes of acts, done in good faith for the purpose of repelling\\nunlawful aggressions, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the\\nmanly spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger.269.\\n[s 96.1] Principle.—\\nThe basic principle underlying the doctrine of the right of private defence is that when\\nan individual or his property is faced with a danger and immediate aid from the State\\nmachinery is not readily available, that individual is entitled to protect himself and his\\nproperty.270. The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly\\nconfronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation.\\nThat being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending\\nhimself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the\\ninjury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should\\nnot exceed its legitimate purpose. The law does not require a law abiding citizen to\\nbehave like a coward when confronted with an imminent unlawful aggression. There is\\nnothing more degrading to the human spirit than to run away in face of danger. The\\nright of private defence is thus, designed to serve a social purpose and deserves to be\\nfostered within the prescribed limits. The IPC, 1860 deﬁnes homicide in self-defence as\\na form of substantive right, and therefore, save and except the restrictions imposed on\\nthe right of the Code itself, it seems that the special rule of English Law as to the duty\\nof retreating will have no application to this country where there is a real need for\\ndefending oneself against deadly assaults. The right to protect one's own person and\\nproperty against the unlawful aggressions of others is a right inherent in man. The duty\\nof protecting the person and property of others is a duty which man owes to society of\\nwhich he is a member and the preservation of which is both his interest and duty. It is,\\nindeed, a duty which ﬂows from human sympathy.\\nAs Bentham said:\\nIt is a noble movement of the heart, that indignation which kindles at the sight of the feeble\\ninjured by the strong. It is noble movement which makes us forget our danger at the ﬁrst cry\\nof distress..... It concerns the public safety that every honest man should consider himself\\nas the natural protector of every other.\\nBut such protection must not be extended beyond the necessities of the case;\\notherwise it will encourage a spirit or lawlessness and disorder. The right has,\\ntherefore, been restricted to offences against the human body and those relating to\\naggression on property. Right of private defence of person and property is recognized\\nin all free, civilised, democratic societies within certain reasonable limits. Those limits\\nare dictated by two considerations: (1) that the same right is claimed by all other\\nmembers of the society and (2) that it is the State which generally undertakes the\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of law and order. The citizens, as a general rule, are\\nneither expected to run away for safety when faced with grave and imminent danger to\\ntheir person or property as a result of unlawful aggression, nor are they expected, by\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 320}),\n",

The section does not deﬁne the expression \"right of\\nprivate defence\". It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the\\nexercise of such right.272. While providing for exercise of the right, care has been taken\\nin IPC, 1860 not to provide and has not devised a mechanism whereby an attack may\\nbe a pretence for killing. A right to defend does not include a right to launch an\\noffensive, particularly when the need to defend no longer survived.273. Just because\\none circumstance exists amongst the various factors, which appears to favour the\\nperson claiming right of self-defence, does not mean that he gets the right to cause the\\ndeath of the other person. Even the right of self-defence has to be exercised directly in\\nproportion to the extent of aggression.274.\\n[s 96.3] Test.—\\nWhether in a particular set of circumstances, a person legitimately acted in the\\nexercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the\\nfacts and circumstances of each case. No test in the abstract for determining such a\\nquestion can be laid down. In determining this question of fact, the Court must\\nconsider all the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to\\nplead in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that\\nthe right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to\\nconsider such a plea.275. The means and the force a threatened person adopts at the\\nspur of the moment to ward off the danger and to save himself or his property cannot\\nbe weighed in golden scales. It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down abstract\\nparameters which can be applied to determine as to whether the means and force\\nadopted by the threatened person was proper or not. Answer to such a question\\ndepends upon host of factors like the prevailing circumstances at the spot; his feelings\\nat the relevant time; the confusion and the excitement depending on the nature of\\nassault on him etc. Nonetheless, the exercise of the right of private defence can never\\nbe vindictive or malicious. It would be repugnant to the very concept of private\\ndefence.276. A person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot weigh in\\ngolden scales in the spur of moment and in the heat of circumstances, the number of\\ninjuries required to disarm the assailants who were armed with weapons. In moments\\nof excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often diﬃcult to expect the parties\\nto preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation\\ncommensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use\\nof force, it would be lawful to repel the force in self-defence and the right of private\\ndefence commences, as soon as the threat becomes so imminent. Such situations\\nhave to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes\\nto detect slight or even marginal overstepping. Due weightage has to be given to, and\\nhyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of\\nthe moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct,\\nwhere self-preservation is the paramount consideration. But, if the fact situation shows\\nthat in the guise of self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault the\\noriginal aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension has disappeared,\\nthe plea of right of private defence can legitimately be negatived.

In adjudging the question as to whether more force\\nthan was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be\\ninappropriate, as held by this Court, to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would\\nbe so natural in a Court room, or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a\\nperfectly cool bystander. The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to\\nhimself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step-by-step with any arithmetical\\nexactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary\\ntimes or under normal circumstances.278.\\nMere use of abusive language does not give rise to private defence. Thus, where the\\ndeceased about a month before the murder had tried to outrage the modesty of the\\nwife of the accused and thereafter on the day of the incident cut a rustic joke enquiring\\nwhether the accused had not kept buffaloes for drinking milk which lead the accused\\nto beat the deceased mercilessly resulting in his death, it was held that giving the most\\ncharitable interpretation one could not ﬁnd a single circumstance which will give the\\naccused the beneﬁt of the right of private defence and the interval between the attempt\\nto outrage the modesty of the accused's wife and the murder being too long he was\\nalso not entitled to get the beneﬁt of grave and sudden provocation within the meaning\\nof exception 1 to section 300, IPC, 1860.279. Giving a general view of all the provisions\\non this right in Munney Khan v State,280. the Supreme Court observed:\\nThe right of private defence is codiﬁed in sections 96 to 106, IPC, which have all to be\\nread together in order to have a proper grasp of the scope and limitations of this right.\\nBy enacting the sections the authors of the Code wanted to except from the operation\\nof its penal clauses acts done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful\\naggression.281.\\nSummary of Principles regarding Private defence\\n(i)Self-preservation is the basic human instinct and is duly recognized by the\\ncriminal jurisprudence of all civilized countries. All free, democratic and civilized\\ncountries recognize the right of private defence within certain reasonable limits.\\n(ii)The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted\\nwith the necessity of averting an impending danger and not of self-creation.\\n(iii)A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right of self-defence into\\noperation. In other words, it is not necessary that there should be an actual\\ncommission of the offence in order to give rise to the right of private defence. It\\nis enough if the accused apprehended that such an offence is contemplated\\nand it is likely to be committed if the right of private defence is not exercised.\\n(iv)The right of private defence commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension\\narises and it is co-terminus with the duration of such apprehension.\\n(v)It is unrealistic to expect a person under assault to modulate his defence step by\\nstep with any arithmetical exactitude.\\n(vi)In private defence the force used by the accused ought not to be wholly\\ndisproportionate or much greater than necessary for protection of the person or\\nproperty.\\n(vii)It is well settled that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open\\nto consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.\\n(viii)The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 322}),\n",

Only then one can get a comprehensive view of the scope and limitations of the\\nright.283.\\n1. Availability or Non-availability of private defence.—Factors to be kept in view.— In\\norder to ﬁnd whether right of private defence is available or not, the entire incident\\nmust be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting. The injuries received by\\nthe accused, the imminence of threat to his safety, the injuries caused by the accused\\nand the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public\\nauthorities are all relevant factors to be considered on a plea of private defence.284.\\nThe right of private defence is a defence right. It is neither a right of aggression nor a\\nright of reprisal. There is no right of private defence where there is no apprehension of\\ndanger. Right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted\\nwith the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. The necessity\\nmust be a present necessity whether real or only apparent.285. It remains a question of\\nfact whether the right has been legitimately exercised.286. Thus, running to house,\\nfetching a sword and assaulting the deceased are by no means a matter of chance.\\nThese acts bear stamp of a design to kill and take the case out of the purview of\\nprivate defence.287. But where the accused was dispossessed of his land by a party of\\nmen and he ran to his residence from where he fetched his gun and came back within\\n15 minutes to ﬁre at and injure them, he was held to be within his rights, but when he\\nwent further still and chased and injured a person who was just standing by there and\\nwho died, in reference to him the accused had no right of private defence.288. Along\\nwith the above factors one has also to remember the following limitations on the right\\nof private defence of person or property:\\n(i)that if there is suﬃcient time for recourse to public authorities, the right are not\\navailable;\\n(ii)that more harm than that is necessary should not be caused;\\n(iii)that there must be a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt or hurt\\nto the person or damage to the property concerned.289. Where on account of\\nsome incident, the accused was confronted by three persons; it was held that\\nthe superiority in numbers in itself could in all probability have been construed\\nby the accused as an imminent danger to himself thus, giving him the signal to\\nact in exercise of the right of private defence.290.\\nThe need to act must not have been created by the conduct of the accused in the\\nimmediate context of the incident which was likely or intended to give rise to that\\nneed.291. The Supreme Court reiterated the various principles governing the law of\\nprivate defence and observed that it was essentially a defensive right and did not\\ninclude the right to launch an offensive attack, particularly when the need for defence\\nno longer existed.292.

It is subject\\nto the restrictions indicated in section 99 which are as important as the right itself.293.\\n[s 96.4] CASES.—Plea of Private Defence rejected.—\\nAfter inﬂicting injuries on person of ﬁrst deceased, accused persons ran towards\\nsecond deceased, who was standing ten steps away from place of incident. Further\\nafter seeing incident relating to death of ﬁrst deceased, second deceased started\\nrunning towards Durga-ki-Dhani and was chased by accused persons and they inﬂicted\\nlathi blows on his person. Accused had no right to invoke right of self-defence by\\nchasing second deceased and to cause fatal injuries upon him.294. Where the accused\\nwere in fact the aggressors and being members of the aggressors party none of the\\naccused can claim right of self-defence.295. Merely because there was a quarrel and\\nsome of the accused person sustained injuries, that does not confer a right of private\\ndefence extending to the extent of causing death. It has to be established that the\\naccused person were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and\\nproperty that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary. Right of private\\ndefence has been rightly discarded.296.\\nThe defence claimed that the place of occurrence was the house of the accused and,\\ntherefore, they had acted in self-defence but that was not proved through any leading\\nevidence despite the examination of the accused under section 313 of the Cr PC, 1973,\\nit was held that the right of self-defence was not available to them.297.\\n[s 96.5] Social nature of defence.—\\nThe right of private defence is not restricted to the particular person who is under\\nattack. It extends to the society as a whole. It is available to any member of the society\\nwho rises to the occasion. But it is wholly a social obligation without any legal\\novertones.298.\\n[s 96.6] Material that accused may rely on.—\\nAn accused entitled to rely for constructing his private defence on the material on\\nrecord brought by the prosecution.299. Without formally taking a plea of self-defence,\\nthe accused has a right to probabilise such defence on the basis of the prosecution\\nevidence and if he succeeds in his effort, the Court can give him such a beneﬁt.300.\\n2. Duty to retreat, if any.—It is now well settled that the rule of retreat which Common\\nLaw Courts espoused is not relevant under the IPC, 1860. If a man's property is in\\nimminent danger of being impaired or attacked he has the right to resort to such\\nmeasures as would be reasonably necessary to thwart the attempt to protect his\\nproperty.301. Under the common law the doctrine of necessity permitted one to defend\\none's person or property or the person or property of others against an unjustiﬁed\\nattack by the use of reasonable force. In determining what was reasonable force, which\\nin the Indian context means minimum force under section 99, IPC, 1860, the common\\nlaw Courts always insisted if the accused could prevent the commission of crime\\nagainst him by retreating. On this rule of retreat one would like to ask: if a person is\\nattacked by an armed burglar in his own room, he is expected to run away leaving the\\nburglar to act as he liked.302.

Law does not expect a citizen to be a rank coward or leave his\\nown house at the mercy of the burglar.304. In spite of this clear exposition of the law in\\nJaidev's case Sarkaria, J, held in Yogendra Morarji's case305. that one must ﬁrst try to\\navoid the attack by retreating otherwise one would not be entitled to get the beneﬁt of\\nprivate defence. It appears that Jaidev's case was not canvassed before the learned\\njudges who decided the latter case. It is submitted with utmost respect that the former\\nview as held in Jaidev's case, appears to be more reasonable and has to be preferred.\\n3. No Private defence in a free ﬁght.—Where both sides can be convicted for their\\nindividual acts, normally no right of private defence is available to either party and they\\nwill be guilty of their respective acts.306. Where two parties come armed with\\ndetermination to measure their strength and to settle a dispute by force and in the\\nensuing ﬁght both sides receive injuries, no question of right of private defence arises.\\nIn such a case of free ﬁght both parties are aggressors and none of them can claim\\nright of private defence.307. In a free ﬁght between two groups resulting in the death of\\none and injuries to several others both grievous and simple, all the accused\\nparticipated in the ﬁght. The plea of one of the accused that he joined the ﬁght later\\nand acted in defence of other co-accused was held to be not tenable. The Court\\nobserved that his case could not be separated by giving him right of private defence\\nunder the beneﬁt of doubt.308. In a sudden ﬁght between two groups in heat of passion\\ndeath of a man was caused and several others on both the sides were injured. The\\ndeceased opened the assault ﬁrst. It was held that in such ﬁghts the question that\\nwhich party opened attack ﬁrst is immaterial. Plea of right of self-defence was not\\nallowed to the accused.309. Where two groups forming an unlawful assembly over the\\npossession of land in dispute which was in peaceful possession of neither group,\\nindulged in free ﬁght resulting in the death of two persons of a group, it was held that\\nright of private defence was not available to either group.310.\\nThe right to voluntary causing of death or any other harm is available against the\\nassailant and not against any other person.311.\\n4. Injury to accused.—If makes out private defence.—Number of injuries on the\\naccused by itself may not be suﬃcient to establish the right of private defence.312. The\\nnumber of injuries is not always considered to be a safe criterion for determining who\\nthe aggressor was. It can also not be laid down as an unqualiﬁed proposition of law\\nthat whenever injuries are on the body of the accused person, the presumption must\\nnecessarily be raised that the accused person had caused injuries in exercise of the\\nright of private defence. The defence has to further establish that the injury so caused\\non the accused probabilise the version of the right of private defence.313. Non-\\nexplanation of injuries on the person of the accused is a factor of great importance and\\nthis fact may induce the Court in judging the veracity of prosecution witnesses with\\nconsiderable care.314. The right of private defence cannot justiﬁably be raised by\\nshowing that one of the accused had suffered some minor injuries and the prosecution\\nhad not explained the same.315. In a given case it may strengthen the plea of private\\ndefence set up by the accused or may create genuine doubt regarding the prosecution\\ncase. At the same time it cannot be laid down as an invariable proposition of law that\\nas soon as it is found that the accused had received injuries in the same transaction in\\nwhich the complainant party was assaulted, the plea of private defence would stand\\nprima facie established and burden would shift on to the prosecution to prove that\\nthose injuries were caused to the accused in self-defence by the complainant party.316.\\nWhen the accused turned back from the house of the deceased whom they had visited,\\nthe deceased followed them along with his brother and mother and tried to attack them\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 325}),\n",

In a case of murder some of the\\nserious injuries found on the person of the accused were not explained and some of\\nthe prosecution witnesses also were injured, it was held that it could be said that the\\naccused party had acted in exercise of right of private defence and conﬁrmation of the\\nacquittal of all the accused but one by the High Court was not proper.319. Where\\nserious injuries inﬂicted on the person of the accused could not be explained by the\\nprosecution, the accused could be said to be entitled to the right of private defence.\\nTheir conviction under section 300 was held to be not proper.320.\\nIn State of UP v Mukunde,321. the Supreme Court observed that merely on the ground\\nthat the prosecution witnesses have not explained the injuries on the accused, their\\nevidence ought not to be rejected if the Court ﬁnds it probable that the accused might\\nhave acted in exercise of the right of private defence. The Supreme Court also\\nobserved in a subsequent case322. that:\\nit cannot be held as a matter of law or invariably a rule that whenever an accused sustained\\nan injury in the same occurrence the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury and on the\\nfailure of the prosecution to do so, the prosecution case should be disbelieved. Before non-\\nexplanation of injuries on the person of the accused by the prosecution witnesses may\\naffect the prosecution case, the court has to be satisﬁed of the existence of two conditions:\\n(1) that the injuries on the person of the accused were of a serious nature and (ii) such\\ninjuries must have been received at the time of the occurrence in question. Non-explanation\\nof injuries assumes greater signiﬁcance when the evidence consists of interested or\\npartisan witnesses or where the defence gives a version which completes in probability with\\nthat of the prosecution.323.\\nThese rulings were followed in Kashi Ram v State of MP324. The accused persons were\\nalleged to have assaulted the prosecution party, but the prosecution witnesses failed to\\nexplain serious injuries including injuries on the vital parts of the body sustained by one\\nof the accused in the same incident. The Court said that this could not be a ground for\\ndiscarding the prosecution story and for acquittal of all accused persons.\\nWhere the accused had some trivial injuries on non-vital parts but the victim had\\nsuffered as many as 19 injuries including some on vital parts which resulted in his\\ndeath, it could not be believed that the accused had acted in self-defence especially\\nwhen he was arrested ﬁve or six days after the incident but in the intervening time did\\nnot care to get himself medically examined. A plea of private defence cannot be based\\non surmises and speculation.325.\\nThe Supreme Court has also observed that merely because there was a quarrel and the\\naccused persons also sustained injuries, it did not confer a right of private defence to\\nthe extent of causing death. Though such right cannot be weighed in golden scales, it\\nhas at least to be shown that the accused persons were under such grave\\napprehension about the safety of their life and property and that the retaliation to the\\nextent actually done was absolutely necessary.326.\\nThe number of injuries is not always a safe criterion for determining as to who was the\\naggressor. It cannot be stated as a universal rule that whenever injuries are on the body\\nof the accused person, a presumption must necessarily be raised that the accused\\npersons had caused injuries in the exercise of the right of private defence.

To put it differently, the right\\nis one of defence and not of requital or reprisal. Such being the nature of the right, the High\\nCourt could not have exonerated the accused persons of the charges levelled against them\\nby bestowing on them the right to retaliate and attack the complainant party.329.\\n[s 96.8] Where private defence not pleaded.—\\nIf circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is\\nopen to the Court to consider such a plea, even if accused had not taken it. A right of\\nprivate defence need not speciﬁcally be taken and in the event the Court on the basis of\\nthe materials placed on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion, the Court\\nmay act thereupon.330. Where the right of private defence was not pleaded by the\\naccused, but it appeared that the complainant was the aggressor, the Bombay High\\nCourt held that the beneﬁt of such defence could still be given to the accused.331. Fact\\nthat accused pleaded alibi-itself will not preclude the Court from giving him also the\\nright of private defence if on proper appraisal of evidence and other material on\\nrecords, Court ﬁnds it to be available to him.332. The right of private defence cannot be\\ndenied merely because the accused adopted a different line of defence particularly\\nwhen the evidence adduced by the prosecution would indicate that they were put under\\na situation where they could reasonably have apprehended grievous hurt even to one of\\nthem.333. The Supreme Court endorsed this principle by saying that it is not necessary\\nthat the plea of private defence must always be taken by the accused person. Even if\\nthe accused does not do so, the Court can consider it if the circumstances show that\\nthe right of private defence was legitimately exercised.334.\\nThe accused has not to plead self-defence by examining some witnesses or by making\\nany statement. But there has to be some material available on record to indicate that\\nthe accused had attacked the deceased in exercise of the right of self-defence.335.\\n[s 96.9] In appeal.—\\nIt is permissible for accused to raise that plea at the stage of appeal as the settled\\nlegal position is that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to\\nconsider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.336.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 327}),\n",

If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint,\\nthe case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed\\nas an offence.4. Investigating oﬃcer is bound to investigate and conﬁrm that despite\\nwhat is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall\\nconstitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC,\\n1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, deﬁnition of every offence is to be\\nunderstood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not\\nconﬁne merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and\\ncircumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated\\ninto, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that\\nan investigating oﬃcer will be able to conﬁrm whether the act committed by a person\\nis an offence or not, as deﬁned in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General\\nExceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall\\nin a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very\\nchapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of\\nlaw or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\\nOf the Right of Private Defence\\n[s 97] Right of private defence of the body and of property.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 334}),\n",

Section 99 provides the limitations. These two sections combined\\ntogether lay down the principles of the right of private defence.\\nThe ﬁrst clause of this section provides for the defence of body against any offence\\naffecting the human body. The second provides for the defence of property against an\\nact which amounts to the commission of certain offences.\\nThere is no obligation upon a person entitled to exercise the right of private defence\\nand to defend his person or property, to retire merely because his assailant threatens\\nhim with violence.337.\\nExplaining the genesis of the rule, the Supreme Court has observed:338.\\n\"It is important to bear in mind that self-preservation of one\\'s life is the necessary\\nconcomitant of the right of life enshrined in Art. 21 of the Constitution of India, fundamental\\nin nature, sacred, precious and inviolable. The importance and validity of the duty and right\\nto self-preservation has a species in the right of self-defence in criminal law. Centuries ago\\nthinkers of this great land conceived of such right and recognised it.\"\\n[s 97.1] Aggressor has no right of private defence.—\\nThe right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive or aggression.339.\\nThe right of private defence does not arise where the accused were the aggressors and\\nthe question of exceeding such right also does not arise.340. The Supreme Court\\nadded, in this case, that the right of self-defence arises when there is unexpected\\napprehension and one is taken unawares, or the accused happens to kill accidentally\\nwhile using reasonable force private defence can be used to ward off unlawful force, or\\nto prevent it, to avoid unlawful detention and to escape from such detention.341.\\nWhen the father of the accused was trying to forcibly remove the gate of the thrashing\\nground of the deceased which was situated on the land of the deceased, his act\\namounted to an offence of \\'mischief\\'. And, if the deceased while protecting his own\\nproperty assaulted the father of the accused with a lathi, and the accused killed him in\\nreturn, the accused could not claim the right of private defence of body of his\\nfather.342. In another case of the same kind the father of the accused was trying to pull\\nout the gate of the deceased thrashing mill and on the deceased assaulting him in\\nprotection, the accused struck him dead. The right of private defence was not available\\nin the circumstances.343. Where the parties went away from the property over which\\nthey were ﬁghting, the death caused at that shifted place was not a justiﬁable exercise\\nof the right of private defence.344. Where the accused succeeded in establishing their\\nright to the property in dispute through the Court and then went to the ﬁeld with a view', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 335}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='to ask the other party to vacate the premises, it was held that it by itself did not render\\nthem to be aggressors for the purpose of denying them the beneﬁt of right of self-\\ndefence.345.\\nNumber of injuries is not always the safe criterion for determining who the aggressor\\nis. The fact of injuries on the body of the accused does not by itself create the\\npresumption that the accused was entitled to the right of private defence.346.\\n[s 97.2] Unlawful assembly.—\\nSo long as an assembly of persons is acting in exercise of the right of private defence it\\ncannot be an unlawful assembly. An assembly though lawful to begin with, may in the\\ncourse of events become unlawful. So long as the accused persons were acting in\\nexercise of right of private defence, their object was not unlawful and so there was no\\nunlawful assembly but once they exceeded the right, the assembly ceased to be lawful\\nand became an unlawful assembly. There too only such of the members of the\\nassembly who shared the object of doing anything in excess of the exercise of right of\\nprivate defence, alone would be liable to be punished for the acts committed in\\nprosecution of the common object or for their individual unlawful acts.347.\\n[s 97.3] Right of private defence to be pleaded.—\\nIn a Supreme Court case it is stated,\\nIt is well settled that even if an accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to the Court\\nto consider such a plea if the same arises from materials on record.348.\\nBut if no plea was entered on behalf of the accused and there were also no\\ncircumstances to show that the accused had probably the right of private defence,\\nsuch a right could not be presumed on behalf of the accused on mere conjectures and\\nsurmises.349. A mere bald assertion without any evidence of facts and circumstances\\ndoes not make out a case of private defence.350. The accused can, however, make out\\nhis plea by mere preponderance of probabilities from materials already on record and\\nneed not prove it to the hilt.351. Where by preponderance of probabilities the plea of\\nprivate defence of the accused is plausible, beneﬁt should be extended to the\\naccused.352. Failure on the part of the prosecution to prove that the injuries on the\\nperson of the accused were not caused in self-defence, makes the defence of the\\naccused probable and he is entitled to its beneﬁt because he has not to prove his\\ndefence beyond reasonable doubt.353. Where the accused set up the plea of self-\\ndefence only during trial and not during investigation, it was held that this was not a\\nground for rejecting the plea.354. The accused on the observation of the High Court\\nthat the deceased was stabbed by the appellant, not in pursuance of any pre-planned\\nattack, but being under the impression that the deceased was coming to attack him.\\nThe said observation cannot be read out of context to make out a case that the\\naccused acted in self-defence. Such a plea is neither put forth in the statement under\\nsection 313 nor brought out in the cross examination of any of the prosecution\\nwitnesses.355. It is true that the right of private defence need not speciﬁcally be taken\\nand in the event the Court on the basis of the materials on record is in a position to\\ncome to such a conclusion, despite some other plea having been raised, that such a\\ncase had been made out, it may act thereupon.356.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 336}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 97.4] CASES.—Defence of person.—\\nUnder circumstances which might have induced the belief that a man was cutting the\\nthroat of his wife, their son shot and killed his father. It was held that if the son had\\nreasonable ground for believing and honestly believed that his act was necessary for\\nthe defence of his mother, the homicide was excusable.357. Where a girl was being\\nsexually molested and her father hit the assailant resulting in consequential death, it\\nwas held that the father was entitled to the right of private defence irrespective of the\\nfact whether the affair was with or without consent because of the girl being a\\nminor.358. Where a man found his wife in compromising position with a person who\\nsprang at the husband and caused him multiple injuries, some of them grievous, the\\nhusband thereafter gave a chopper blow resulting in the death of that person, it was\\nheld that the husband had not exceeded his right of private defence and was entitled to\\nacquittal.359. Where the father of the accused was being given lathi blows by the\\ncomplainant party, the accused ﬁred from the licensed gun of his father to defend his\\nfather, it was held that he had acted in the exercise of the right of private defence\\nwhether the injuries caused to his father were simple or grievous.360. Trespassers on\\nthe property of another cannot get any beneﬁt of right of private defence if they are\\nattacked by the person in possession of the property.361. However no one including the\\ntrue owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in\\nsettled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of\\nlaw, he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner. Such\\npossession of the trespasser must extend over a suﬃciently long period and\\nacquiesced in by the true owner.362. Though law permits even a trespasser in settled\\npossession to defend his possession but, it does not permit a person to take the law in\\nhis own hand to take forcible possession merely because he has obtained a favourable\\norder under section 145 Cr PC, 1973. Such a person cannot claim private defence.363.\\nSettled possession means such clear and effective physical possession that under the\\ncriminal law he, even if he is a trespasser, gets the right to defend his possession of the\\nproperty against an attack even by the true owner.364. If no party is proved to be in\\nsettled possession, the question of exercise of right of private defence does not\\narise.365. Where the accused were in possession of the property and had grown the\\npaddy, they were entitled to defend their possession by using reasonable force which in\\nthe instant case went up to causing of death as the party in possession was attacked\\nand grievous blows were given to them.366. Where the prosecution party attacked the\\naccused, his brothers and others with sharp edged weapons and lathis and when they\\ntried to enter the latter's house, the accused ﬁred at the crowd resulting in the death of\\na man and injuries to others, it was held that the accused had acted only in the exercise\\nof the right of private defence and he was entitled to complete acquittal.367. Where the\\naccused was ﬁred at to dispel his party from attempting to rescue their friend from\\nillegal police detention and an informer accompanying the police who tried to prevent\\nthem from snatching the police gun received fatal injuries, it was held that they were\\nentitled to the right of private defence.368. Where a fatal injury was caused in\\nconsequence of hot exchange of words, the right of private defence was held to be not\\navailable.369. The Supreme Court has suggested that the number and nature of injuries\\nsustained by the accused and the deceased in any case, may furnish good evidence to\\nconsider whether the accused was acting in private defence and, if so, whether he had\\nexceeded his right. In the state of the evidence on record in that case and the number\\nof injuries suffered by the accused, the Court did not accede to the contention that the\\nright was not properly exercised.370.\\n[s 97.5] Defence of another person.—\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 337}),\n",

Even if a trespass has been\\ncommitted, in certain situations, right of private defence can be used to eject the\\ntrespassers.375. Where the accused had no right, title, interest or possession of the\\nland in issue, right of private defence of property did not vest in him.376.\\nWhere the complainant party was about 300 feet away from the disputed land and it\\nwas further found that the accused had not shown that there was any injury on the\\nperson of the accused, it was held that no right of private defence arose in favour of the\\naccused. 377.\\n[s 97.7] Open space.—\\nThough private defence is available in respect of criminal trespass or mischief as\\nagainst the property owned by himself or of any other person, but criminal trespass is\\nnot enumerated as one of the offences under section 103 IPC, 1860. Therefore, the\\nright of private defence of property will not extend to the causing of death of the\\nperson who committed such acts, if the act of trespass is in respect of an open land.\\nOnly a house-trespass committed under such circumstances as may reasonably cause\\napprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence is enumerated as\\none of the offences under section 103.378. But in another judgment Supreme Court\\nheld that there is no law that right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to a\\ndispute over an open space.379. Where the trespasser was in settled possession of the\\nﬁeld in question, and the party who claimed ownership started ploughing the ﬁeld, it\\nwas held that the trespasser (accused) had the right of private defence of his\\npossession over property and offer resistance, but that he exceeded that right in\\ncausing death. His act fell under exception 2 to section 300 and punishable under\\nsection 304, Part I.380. Where a goat of the accused entered the ﬁeld of another and he\\nwas trying to take it way, the other struck him with lathi blows and also his companion\\nwho came to his rescue. Only then the accused retaliated with lathi blows resulting in\\ndeath. Supreme Court upheld the acquittal.381. The right is subject to restrictions\\nimposed by section 99, the accused party was in possession of the land, the deceased\\nparty wanted to enter into possession forcibly. One of the aggressors was killed and\\nanother grievously hurt. The accused that caused the death was held to be guilty of\\nexceeding the right of private defence. The acquittal of the person who caused\\ngrievous hurt with a spear was held to be not proper. He was liable to be convicted\\nunder section 326.382. Accused having not been in settled possession had no right to\\nself-defence to defend the possession of the property.383. Occurrence took place on\\nthe land which was in possession of deceased.

       " Document(page_content=\"conviction was shifted from under section 302 to that under section 304 Part 1.386.\\nThe right of private defence of property (share in land) was held to have been exceeded\\nwhen the deceased's side being armed with lathis only, the accused party ﬁred at them\\nwith a gun, killing one and injuring others. The right of private defence was not available\\nto them.387.\\nWhere the ﬁnding of the Courts below was that the accused and his companions were\\naggressors because they assaulted the victim and his children when they came out to\\nprotest against cutting of their by the accused, it was held that the beneﬁt of the right\\nof private defence was not available to the accused.388.\\nDefence of property may create circumstances ripening into the right of defence of\\nperson. This is so because even in defending property, the attack and counter-attack is\\nlikely to be on person. This was the situation in a case in which the accused while\\ndefending land over which they had possession; they became the victim of attack on\\nperson with sharp cutting weapons. It became their right to repel the danger of\\ngrievous hurt or even death and to use for that purpose reasonably appropriate force.\\nTheir right extended to cause death of the aggressors if that could be the only way of\\nsaving themselves.389.\\n[s 97.8] CASES.—Exceeding private defence.—\\nThe father of the accused was attacked by the deceased with a lathi and suffered a\\nsimple injury on his head, whereupon the accused in order to protect his father\\nadministered a fatal blow on the chest of the deceased with a ballam. It was held that\\nthough the accused had the right of private defence, he had obviously exceeded it and\\nwas, therefore, liable under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.390. A somewhat contrary view\\nhas, however, been taken by the Supreme Court in a later case where too the accused\\nhad exercised his right of private defence against a lathi blow on the head. Thus, in Deo\\nNarain's case it has been held that the accused was justiﬁed in using his spear though\\nthe other party had aimed only a lathi blow on the head, which being a vulnerable part\\neven a lathi blow could prove dangerous.391. It thus, appears that the part of the body\\nagainst which the attack is directed is more important than the weapon used. Where\\nthe deceased attacked the accused with a stick and the accused retaliated by stabbing\\nthe former to death his offence fell under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860, as he had\\nexceeded the right of private defence.392. Evidence on record showed that accused had\\nreceived many injuries on his person, and exercised right of private defence of person\\nin good faith. He had sustained four injuries on various parts of his body including on\\nvital parts, thus, case would be covered by Exception 2 to section 300 of IPC, 1860. The\\nnature of weapon used, circumstances in which incident took place, injuries on body of\\naccused as well as deceased, showed that there was no premeditation. He had\\nexercised his right of self-defence but having regard to the injuries inﬂicted by him on\\ndeceased, he exceeded same.393. Where the accused, a person with only one hand was\\nattacked with a bamboo and sustained several injuries and then to ward off further\\nattack gave only one blow with a pen-knife on the aggressor which unfortunately fell on\\na vital part resulting in his death, it could not be said that he had exceeded his right of\\nprivate defence. For the accused it was a case of life or death struggle and his case,\\ntherefore, squarely fell within the ambit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860,\\nand he could not be held guilty of any offence.394. In a sudden group clash over a\\nhouse both sides received injuries and one person was killed. There was no prior\\nenmity between two groups and the whole incident developed suddenly. Accused\\npersons received quite a number of injuries, some on vital parts, and the prosecution\\nwas not able to explain those injuries. It was held that the accused could not be said to\\nhave exceeded the right of private defence. Their conviction was set aside.395.

The Supreme Court held that it could\\nnot be said of any one of them that he exceeded the right of private defence. Hence,\\nthey could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34.396. The accused\\nusing his licenced gun ﬁred only one shot after receiving a severe blow on his head\\nfracturing his skull. It was held that he did not exceed his right of self-defence.397.

The accused inﬂicted knife injuries on him to extricate himself but did not\\ninﬂict any further injury after freeing himself.

He is not required to prove\\nit beyond reasonable doubt. The Court has only to examine probabilities in appreciating\\nthe plea. In the present case, the accused had miserably failed to establish or even to\\nprobablise his defence. The deceased persons had merely asked them why they had\\ncut the mature crop, when they became the victim of attack. They were unarmed.403.\\nThe accused need not take the plea of private defence explicitly. He can succeed in his\\nplea if he is able to bring out from the evidence of the prosecution witness or other\\nevidence of the prosecution witness or other evidence that the apparent criminal act\\nwas committed by him in exercise of private defence.

If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860.

This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC,\\n1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, deﬁnition of every offence is to be\\nunderstood subject to the \"General Exceptions\".

Therefore, general exceptions are part of deﬁnition of every\\noffence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the\\naccused.1.\\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\\n1.Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\\n2.Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\\n3.Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\\n4.Act of a person justiﬁed, or believing himself justiﬁed, by law (section 79).\\n5.Act caused by accident (section 80).\\n6.Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm\\n(section 81).\\n7.Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\\n8.Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding\\n(section 83).\\n9.Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\\n10.Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\\n11.Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of\\nthe sufferer (section 87).\\n12.Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\\n13.Act done in good faith for the beneﬁt of a child or an insane person by or by the\\nconsent of guardian (section 89).\\n14.Act done in good faith for the beneﬁt of a person without consent (section 92).\\n15.Communication made in good faith to a person for his beneﬁt (section 93).\\n16.Act done under threat of death (section 94).\\n17.Act causing slight harm (section 95).', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 348}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='18.Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\\n1.Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\\n2.Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\\n3.Accident (section 80).\\n4.Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\\n5.Consent (sections 87, 90).\\n6.Triﬂing acts (section 95).\\n7.Private defence (sections 96–106).\\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence,\\nthe burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of\\nthe general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso\\ncontained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law deﬁning the offence, is\\nupon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the\\nbeneﬁt of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of\\nevidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused\\nmust lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint,\\nthe case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed\\nas an offence.4. Investigating oﬃcer is bound to investigate and conﬁrm that despite\\nwhat is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall\\nconstitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC,\\n1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, deﬁnition of every offence is to be\\nunderstood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not\\nconﬁne merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and\\ncircumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated\\ninto, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that\\nan investigating oﬃcer will be able to conﬁrm whether the act committed by a person\\nis an offence or not, as deﬁned in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General\\nExceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall\\nin a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very\\nchapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of\\nlaw or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\\nOf the Right of Private Defence\\n[s 99] Acts against which there is no right of private defence.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 349}),\n",

Where oﬃcers of Delhi Municipal Corporation acting in good faith\\nby virtue of powers delegated to them by the Commissioner attempted to seize the\\nbuffalo of the accused with a view to recover arrears of milk tax, the mere fact that no\\nprior notice was issued to the accused as required by the Municipal Act would not\\nmake their act entirely outside the law and as such accused had no private defence\\nunder section 99 of the Code. The oﬃcers had merely erred in exercise of their\\npowers.406. The clause applies to a case where an oﬃcial has done wrongly, what he\\nmight have done rightly, but not to cases where the act could not have been done\\nrightly at all by the oﬃcial concerned.407. The clause applies where a public servant\\nacts irregularly in the exercise of his powers, and not where he acts outside the scope\\nof his powers.408. Where a police oﬃcer acting bona ﬁde under colour of his oﬃce\\narrests a person but without authority, the person so arrested has no right of self-\\ndefence against the oﬃcer.409. If the act of a public servant is ultra vires the right of\\nprivate defence may be exercised against him.410. A police-oﬃcer, holding a search,\\nwithout a written authority, cannot be said to be acting 'under colour of his oﬃce'.411.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 350}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 99.2] CASES.—Resistance to oﬃcer acting without warrant.—\\nA police-oﬃcer attempted without a search-warrant to enter a house in search of\\nproperty alleged to have been stolen and was obstructed and resisted. It was held that,\\neven though the oﬃcer was not strictly justiﬁed in searching the house without a\\nwarrant, the person obstructing and resisting could not set up the illegality of the\\noﬃcer's proceeding as a justiﬁcation of his obstruction, as it was not shown that the\\noﬃcer was acting otherwise than in good faith and without malice.412. Where a raiding\\nparty organized by the oﬃcial of the Municipal Corporation to round up stray cattle\\nwithin the limits of the Corporation, was attacked when it had rounded up some cattle\\nand was leading the cattle to the cattle pound, it was held that the act of the raiding\\nparty was fully justiﬁable by law and that the accused had no right of private\\ndefence.413. Where a party was ﬁred at to dispel them from their attempt to rescue\\ntheir friend from an illegal police detention, it was held that this was suﬃcient to cause\\nreasonable apprehension in their mind of death or grievous injury.414.\\n[s 99.3] Illegal attachment does not justify resistance.—\\nWhere articles protected from attachment were attached, it was held that this act did\\nnot justify resistance.415. Where the property of a person was wrongfully attached as\\nthe property of certain absconders, it was held that the rightful owner had no right of\\nprivate defence of his property, as the police-oﬃcer was acting in good faith under\\ncolour of his oﬃce, and that even supposing the order of attachment might not have\\nbeen properly made, that would in itself not be suﬃcient ground for such a defence.416.\\n[s 99.4] Second clause.—\\nThe ﬁrst clause speaks of acts done by a public servant, this clause, of acts done under\\nthe direction of a public servant. It is not necessary that the doer should be a public\\nservant. Explanation 2 must be read conjointly with this clause.\\n[s 99.5] CASE.—Resistance to execution of warrant.—\\nWhere a police-oﬃcer attempted to execute a warrant the issue of which was illegal, it\\nwas held that the accused were justiﬁed in their resistance.417.\\n[s 99.6] Third clause.—\\nThe third clause of this section must be read with the ﬁrst clause of section 105.418. It\\nplaces an important restriction on the exercise of the right of defence. The right of\\nprivate defence being granted for defence only, it must not and cannot legally be\\nexercised when there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities.\\nThe right of private defence does not take the place of the functions of those public\\nservants who are especially charged with the protection of life and property and the\\napprehension of offenders, and where the assistance of the public authorities can be\\nprocured, the right cannot be lawfully exercised. But the law does not intend that a\\nperson must run away to have recourse to the protection of public authorities when he\\nis attacked instead of defending himself.419.

Where there is\\nimminent danger to the property and the person in possession apprehends substantial\\ndamage thereto, he is entitled to raise his own arms in defence and retaliate to keep\\naway the attack without applying for State aid.420. Where the accused was in rightful\\npossession of the property by virtue of a Court order; under section 145 Cr PC, 1973, he\\nhad every right to throw out the complainant party from the land and demolish the\\nconstruction stealthily put up thereon.421. The important considerations which always\\narise in order to determine whether the action of the accused is covered by the right of\\nprivate defence are, ﬁrst, what is the nature of the apprehended danger, and, second,\\nwhether there was time to have recourse to the police authorities, always remembering\\nthat when both the parties are determined to ﬁght and go up to the land fully armed in\\nfull expectation of an armed conﬂict in order to have a trial of strength the right of\\nprivate defence disappears.422.\\n[s 99.7] CASES.—Time to obtain protection of public authorities.—\\nThe accused received information one evening that the complainants intended to go on\\nhis land on the following day, and uproot the corn sown in it. At about three o'clock next\\nmorning he was informed that the complainants had entered on his land and were\\nploughing up the corn. Thereupon he at once proceeded to the spot, followed by the\\nremaining accused, and remonstrated with the complainants, who commenced an\\nattack on the accused. In the ﬁght which ensued, both sides received serious injuries,\\nand the leader of the complainants' party was killed. It was held that the complainants\\nbeing the aggressors, the accused had the right of private defence and that they were\\nnot bound to act on the information received on the previous evening and seek the\\nprotection of the public authorities, as they had no reason to apprehend a night attack\\non their property.423. In a case involving an old land dispute, one party (accused)\\noffered resistance to prevent the other from ploughing the land and on refusal went up\\nto the place where the other was sitting without arms and inﬂicted stick blows causing\\ndeath, it was held that the accused was rightly convicted. The Court said that a rightful\\nowner can defend his possession against any attempt to dislodge him, but that once a\\ntrespasser has established his foothold; resort should be had to public authorities.424.\\nThe right of private defence does not extend to inﬂicting of more harm than necessary\\nfor the purpose of defence. The prosecution party, in this case, had gone to plough the\\nland which was in the possession of the accused (appellant). The latter had time to go\\nand report the matter to appropriate authorities constituted under the law. But instead\\nof so doing, they brutally attacked the other party resulting in the death of three\\npersons. Thus, there was no right of private defence. It was held that there was no\\nwarrant for converting the conviction from u/section 302 to section 304 Part II.425.\\n[s 99.8] Fourth clause.—\\nThe right of private defence is restricted to not inﬂicting more harm than it is necessary\\nto inﬂict for the purpose of defence. The amount of force necessarily depends on the\\ncircumstances of the case, and there is no protection if the harm is caused by\\nexcessive violence quite unnecessary to the case.426. For example, a person set by his\\nmaster to watch a garden or yard is not at all justiﬁed in shooting at, or injuring in any\\nway, persons who may come into those premises, even in the night. He ought ﬁrst to\\nsee whether he could not take measures for their apprehension.427. The measure of\\nself-defence must always be proportionate to the quantum of force used by the\\nattacker and which it is necessary to repel.428. In dealing with the question as to\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 352}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='whether more force is used than is necessary or than was justiﬁed by the prevailing\\ncircumstances, it would be inappropriate to adopt tests of detached objectivity of a\\nCourt room. The means which a threatened person adopts or the force which he uses\\nshould not be weighed in golden scales.429. Though a person exercising his right of\\nprivate defence is not expected to modulate his defence step by step or tier by tier, yet\\nit is necessary to see that it is not totally disproportionate to the injury sought to be\\naverted, e.g., to ward off a slap one cannot ﬁre a gun. Thus, where the father of the\\naccused was allegedly assaulted with lathis which resulted in simple injuries, the\\naccused was not justiﬁed in ﬁring his gun and thereby killing the attacker. In such a\\ncase it could not be said that there was a reasonable apprehension of death or\\ngrievous hurt within the meaning of clause (1) of section 100, IPC, 1860.430. But at the\\nsame time it should also be remembered that if a man has real justiﬁcation to exercise\\nhis right of private defence, he cannot be held liable if he slightly exceeds his right of\\nprivate defence, e.g., where face to face with a murderous attack he ﬁres two shots in\\nquick succession, for these things cannot be weighed in golden scales.431. The right of\\nprivate defence should not be allowed to be pleaded or availed of as pretext for a\\nvindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose.432.\\n[s 99.9] CASES.—Justiﬁable harm.—\\nA party attempted to rescue a friend from unlawful police detention. Three rounds were\\nﬁred to dispel them. This caused in their mind a reasonable apprehension of death or\\ninjury. They tried to snatch the police gun. A police informer intervened and died of\\ninjuries received in the process. The right of private defence was held to be not\\nexceeded.433. In another case the Supreme Court accepted the defence version that\\nthere were four assailants who had come well prepared to assault at the door of their\\nhouse. In such a situation accused persons could have a reasonable apprehension of\\ndeath or at least of grievous hurt. It was a case of single gunshot which was not\\nrepeated. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused persons had exceeded their\\nright of private defence in any manner.434.\\nIn view of the fact that the accused was pursued, that he only picked up the weapon\\nwhen he was chased and that he used it only once, his sentence was reduced to three\\nyears and nine months.435.\\n[s 99.10] Attack on unarmed persons.—\\nNo right of private defence can exist against an unarmed and unoffending\\nindividual;436. where the injury was caused to the victim on the vital parts of the body\\neven though he and the witnesses present at the spot were all unarmed, it was held\\nthat the question of acting in self-defence did not arise.437.\\n[s 99.11] Sudden quarrel.—\\nThe right of private defence was held to be not available where the incident of lathi\\nblows causing death took place in the course of a sudden ﬁght.438.\\n[s 99.12] More harm caused than necessary.—', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 353}),\n",

Therefore, general exceptions are part of deﬁnition of every\\noffence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the\\naccused.1.\\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\\n1.Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\\n2.Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\\n3.Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\\n4.Act of a person justiﬁed, or believing himself justiﬁed, by law (section 79).\\n5.Act caused by accident (section 80).\\n6.Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm\\n(section 81).\\n7.Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\\n8.Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding\\n(section 83).\\n9.Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\\n10.Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\\n11.Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of\\nthe sufferer (section 87).\\n12.Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\\n13.Act done in good faith for the beneﬁt of a child or an insane person by or by the\\nconsent of guardian (section 89).\\n14.Act done in good faith for the beneﬁt of a person without consent (section 92).\\n15.Communication made in good faith to a person for his beneﬁt (section 93).\\n16.Act done under threat of death (section 94).\\n17.Act causing slight harm (section 95).', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 357}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='18.Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\\n1.Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\\n2.Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\\n3.Accident (section 80).\\n4.Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\\n5.Consent (sections 87, 90).\\n6.Triﬂing acts (section 95).\\n7.Private defence (sections 96–106).\\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence,\\nthe burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of\\nthe general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso\\ncontained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law deﬁning the offence, is\\nupon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the\\nbeneﬁt of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of\\nevidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused\\nmust lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced\\nby the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the\\npresumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence\\nproves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether\\naccusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not,\\nthe police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of\\ncognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860\\nas per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint,\\nthe case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed\\nas an offence.4. Investigating oﬃcer is bound to investigate and conﬁrm that despite\\nwhat is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall\\nconstitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC,\\n1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, deﬁnition of every offence is to be\\nunderstood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not\\nconﬁne merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and\\ncircumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated\\ninto, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that\\nan investigating oﬃcer will be able to conﬁrm whether the act committed by a person\\nis an offence or not, as deﬁned in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General\\nExceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall\\nin a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very\\nchapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of\\nlaw or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\\nOf the Right of Private Defence\\n[s 100] When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 358}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in\\nthe last preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to\\nthe assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the\\ndescriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—\\nFirst.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will\\notherwise be the consequence of such assault;\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous\\nhurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape;\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust;\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting;\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully conﬁning a person, under\\ncircumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable\\nto have recourse to the public authorities for his release.\\n449.[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or\\nadminister acid which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will\\notherwise be the consequence of such act.]\\nCOMMENT.—\\nThe law authorizes a man who is under a reasonable apprehension that his life is in\\ndanger or his body in risk of grievous hurt to inﬂict death upon his assailant either\\nwhen the assault is attempted or directly threatened, but the apprehension must be\\nreasonable and the violence inﬂicted must not be greater than is reasonably necessary\\nfor the purpose of self-defence. It must be proportionate to and commensurate with\\nthe quality and character of the act it is intended to meet and what is done in excess is\\nnot protected. Where the accused was attacked by three persons and sustained an\\ninjury on the forehead, a vital part, he had reasonable apprehension of some hurt to be\\ncaused to him and had the right of self-defence but had exceeded by causing more\\nharm to his assailants than needed. He was liable under section 304, Part I, and not\\nunder section 302.450. Where after receiving nine injuries, two on vital parts, the\\naccused ﬁred one shot from his gun which hit fatally an innocent person, the right of\\nprivate defence extending to cause death was still available to the accused. His\\nconviction under section 304, Part I was set aside.451. Where the complainant's party\\nhad deliberately gathered near the house of the accused and scolded them and caused\\ninjuries to his father, the accused was held justiﬁed in exercising the right of private\\ndefence to defend his father and his conviction under section 300 was set aside.452. It\\nis the reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt that gives rise to the right of\\nprivate defence under clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860., and it has got\\nnothing to do with the actual injury that the person exercising the right of private\\ndefence has suffered, which may or may not be grievous.453. Where the accused fails\\nto make out a case of reasonable apprehension, he cannot claim the right of private\\ndefence.454. Where the life of the accused was not endangered by the ladies armed\\nwith broom sticks and 'chappals', the accused was not entitled to stab one of the ladies\\nto death in exercise of right of private defence.455.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 359}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The extended right of private defence to the extent of causing death of the assailant\\narises only if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is of one of the\\nkinds mentioned in this section.456. Following some earlier rulings, the Supreme Court\\nhas re-emphasised that the mere fact of the accused sustaining some injuries in the\\ncourse of the same transaction does not make it out conclusively that the accused had\\nthe occasion to cause death in private defence.457. Where the attacking party chanced\\nto get at the wife of the accused and the latter pounced upon them with a weapon\\nattacking one of them which was warded off, another came forward and the accused\\nsuccessfully struck him and he died, the accused was held to be within his rights.458.\\nAs against this where two were ﬁghting with lathis and the brother of one of them, who\\nwas outside the danger, struck a lathi blow to the other killing him, he was held to be\\nguilty under section 304-I.459. In a communal tension, both sides pelted stones. The\\naccused ﬁred a gun shot causing death of a person of the other group though no one\\nhad sustained any injury as a result of pelting of stones by the other group. It was held\\nthat the accused had no occasion to act under the right of private defence.460.\\nIn order to justify the act of causing death of assailant, the accused has simply to\\nsatisfy the Court that there was reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt.\\nQuestion whether the apprehension was reasonable or not is a question of fact\\ndepending upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula\\ncan be prescribed in this regard. Weapon used, the manner and nature of assault and\\nother surrounding circumstances should be taken into account while evaluating\\nwhether the apprehension was justiﬁed or not. In the instant case, accused G was\\nassaulted on head by a sharp-edged weapon which caused a bone-deep injury. As per\\nthe defence version there were four assailants who had come well prepared at the door\\nof accused\\'s house to commit assault. Reasonable apprehension of death or at least of\\ngrievous hurt, therefore, could not be ruled out. In such a situation, if single gunshot\\nwas ﬁred it could not be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of\\nprivate defence in any manner.461.\\n[s 100.1] \\'Abducting\\'.—\\nOn a plain reading of clause ﬁfth of this section, there does not seem to be any reason\\nfor holding that the word \\'abducting\\' used in the clause means anything more than\\nwhat is deﬁned as \"abduction\" in section 362. All that the clause requires is that there\\nshould be an assault which is an offence against the human body and that assault\\nshould be with the intention of abducting, and whenever these elements are present the\\nclause will be applicable.462. Thus, a woman could not be taken away by force even by\\nher own husband from a paramour\\'s house and if in these circumstances the paramour\\nand his brother killed the husband to prevent her abduction by the husband, they would\\nbe protected by sub-clause (5) of section 100 of the Penal Code.463. Here law seems to\\nbe contrary to our social conscience, but this interpretation is perfectly in accord with\\nthe language of section 100, IPC, 1860, and the decision of the Supreme Court in\\nViswanath\\'s case464. where too the husband was put to death by a clean stab by his\\nbrother-in-law as he was trying to take away his wife by force from his father-in-law\\'s\\nhouse and in the process had merely dragged his unwilling wife to some distance.\\n[s 100.2] Rescuing woman-folk from attack on modesty.—\\nThe accused heard the cries for help of his widowed sister-in-law. He ran to her house\\nwith gandasa. He found the attacker grappling with her and trying to outrage her\\nmodesty. The accused saved her from his clutches and inﬂicted a gandasa blow while\\nhe was going to run away. The act of the accused was held to have been done in the\\nexercise of the right of private defence. The accused was acquitted.465.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 360}),\n",

It was held that the accused exceeded his right of private defence his\\nconviction was altered from under section 300 to one under section 304, Part I.466.\\nWhenever accused-party sustains injuries in the same occurrence and when the\\ninjuries are grievous in nature it is incumbent upon the prosecution to explain the\\ninjuries on the person of the accused.467.

They assembled in front of the house of\\nthe accused. They came as aggressors. The accused suffered a bone deep injury on\\nhis head. The accused ﬁred a single gunshot which caused death of one of the\\nmembers on the prosecution side. The Court held that the right of private defence was\\nnot exceeded. The accused was given the beneﬁt of doubt.468.\\nWhere the victim was throwing broken bricks at the accused who received simple\\ninjuries and the accused ﬁred at him with his gun, it was held that he exceeded the right\\nof private defence. There was no justiﬁcation for using the gun in such as to cause\\ndeath. Conviction under section 304 Part I was restored.469. The right of private\\ndefence was not allowed to be claimed merely on the ground that there was a quarrel\\nand the accused sustained injuries in the course of it.470.\\n[s 100.4] No danger.—\\nTwo friends were sitting together and consuming liquor. They quarrelled and\\nexchanged blows. One of them inﬂicted two knife wounds on vital parts of the body of\\nthe other. The victim had posed no danger to the attacker, nor did he have any weapons\\nwith him. The plea of self-defence was held to be not available. The accused was\\nconvicted for murder.471. The deceased came to his land and asked the accused party\\nto get the land measured and also tried to dislodge a pole ﬁxed by them. There was no\\nimminent danger to person on property from any act of the deceased. No injuries\\ncaused to anybody. It was held that there was no right of self-defence in the exercise of\\nwhich the deceased could have been killed.472.\\n[s 100.5] Private defence.—\\nThe accused was without any arms when the quarrel started. His action of picking up a\\nstick lying on the ground and hitting the deceased on his head with it showed that he\\nwas trying to save himself from the attack by the deceased and his son. The accused\\nwas acquitted because the circumstances made it obvious that he was acting in self-\\ndefence.473.\\n[s 100.6] Burden of proof.—\\nThe right of private defence is a plea which is available to the accused by the burden of\\nproving the same is on him.474.

The Indian Evidence Act, I of 1872, section 105.COMMENT.—\\nThis section indicates when the right of private defence of the body commences and\\ntill what time it continues. The right commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension\\nof danger to the body arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence,\\nalthough the offence may not have been committed, but not until that there is that\\nreasonable apprehension. The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of\\nthe danger to the body continues.484. It commences and continues as long as danger\\nto body lasts. The extent to which the exercise of the right will be justiﬁed will depend\\nnot on the actual danger but on whether there was reasonable apprehension of such\\ndanger. There must be an attempt or threat and consequent thereon an apprehension\\nof danger; but it is not a mere idle threat, or every apprehension of a rash or timid mind,\\nthat will justify the exercise of the right. Reasonable ground for the apprehension is\\nrequisite. Suppose the threat to proceed from a woman or child and to be addressed to\\na strong man, in such a case there could hardly be a reasonable apprehension. Present\\nand imminent danger seems to be meant.485. The person exercising a right of private\\ndefence must consider whether the threat to his person or his property is real and\\nimmediate. If he reaches the conclusion reasonably that the threat is immediate and\\nreal, he is entitled to exercise his right. In the exercise of his right, he must use force\\nnecessary for the purpose and he must stop using the force as soon as the threat has\\ndisappeared. So long as the threat lasts and the right of private defence can be\\nlegitimately exercised; if the danger is continuing, the right is there; if the danger or the\\napprehension about it has ceased to exist there is no longer the right of private\\ndefence.486. Right commences, as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the\\nbody arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence, although the offence\\nmay not have been committed but not until that there is that reasonable apprehension.\\nThe right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body\\ncontinues.487. There is no right to inﬂict punishment on the wrong-doer for his past act\\nafter the apprehension has ceased to exist. The right of defence ends with the\\nnecessity for it. So where the deceased was ﬂeeing for his life, there was no\\njustiﬁcation to shoot him down. This would be a sheer case of murder and nothing\\nelse.488. Where the testimony of the independent witness showed that the accused\\nchased one of the deceased who ﬂed away from the scene of occurrence and killed\\nhim, they could not be said to have right of private defence as regards the killing of\\nsuch deceased.489. Though the nature of apprehension depends upon the nature of\\nweapon intended to be used or used, it cannot be said that as the complainant's party\\nhad only used lathis, the accused was not justiﬁed in using his spear especially when a\\nblow with a lathi was aimed at a vulnerable part like the head.490.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 372}),\n",

A person whose duty it is to guard a public building is in the same\\nposition, that is to say, it is his duty to protect the property of his employer and he may\\ntake such steps for this purpose as the law permits. The fact that the property to be\\nguarded is public property does not extend the protection given to a guard. Therefore, a\\npolice constable on guard duty at a magazine or other public building is not entitled to\\nﬁre at a person merely because the latter does not answer his challenge.491. The\\ndeceased, none of whom was in possession of any dangerous weapons, were\\nharvesting crop on a plot of land with peaceful intention under the protection of police.\\nThe accused who claimed the crops did not approach the authorities for redress,\\nalthough they had time to do so, sent away the police constables by a ruse and then\\nattacked the deceased with guns and other dangerous weapons and shot them down\\nat close range. It was held by the Supreme Court that the acts of the deceased did not\\namount to robbery and that the accused had no right of private defence of property.492.\\nThe accused was in possession of the plots which were under litigation. Finding his\\nopponent, a blind man, getting the plots ploughed, the accused asked him to stop\\nploughing. On this, 8–10 persons armed with spears and 'lathis' proceeded towards\\nhim. The accused ﬁred a shot from his gun causing death of his opponent, the blind\\nman. The Court observed that a blind villager could not be thought of going to take\\npossession of the plots without mobilising enough man power to deal with resistance\\nlikely to be put up by his adversary. It was held that in the circumstances the right of\\nprivate defence of the person became available to the accused.493.\\nIn the words of the Supreme Court, the High Court committed an error in relation to the\\nplea of self-defence raised on behalf of the accused to the effect that the incident took\\nplace at an open space. There is no law that the right of self-defence cannot be\\nexercised in relation to an open space.494. Reasonable force may be used in defence of\\nproperty.

It is only in the case of a person\\nabetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the\\ncharge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to\\nhave committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.3. The Court noted that in\\nFaguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam4. the appellant was tried for an offence under\\nsection 165A for having abetted the commission of an offence by an oﬃcer, who was\\nacquitted, and it was held that the appellant\\'s conviction for abetment was also not\\nmaintainable. But subsequently in Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar,5. it was considered\\nnot desirable to hold that an abettor cannot be punished if the person actually\\ncommitting the offence is acquitted. The Court said that the abettor\\'s guilt depends\\nupon the nature of the offence abetted and the manner of abetment. It is only in cases\\nof intentional aiding that the abettor would have to be acquitted with the principal\\noffender.6. Following this state of the rulings the Supreme Court ordered the acquittal\\nof the single abettor when the main offender as also all other abettors already stood\\nacquitted.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated that before anybody can be punished for abetment\\nof suicide, it must be proved that the death in question was a suicidal death.7.\\nThe Supreme Court held that the offence of abetment is a separate and independent\\noffence. Where the offence is committed in consequence of the abetment but there is\\nno provision for punishment of such abetment, the abettor is to be punished along with\\nthe offender for the original offence.8.\\nAbetment is constituted by:\\n(1)instigating a person to commit an offence; or\\n(2)engaging in a conspiracy to commit it; or\\n(3)intentionally aiding a person to commit it.\\nThe offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who\\nabets and not upon the act which is done by the person who has abetted. The\\nabetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under section\\n107, Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. However, the words uttered in a ﬁt of anger or\\nomission without any intention cannot be termed as instigation.9.\\n[s 107.1] Mens rea.—\\nIn order to proceed against a person for criminal offence under section 107,\\nprosecution must prove the element of mens rea. Negligence or carelessness or the\\nfacilitation cannot be termed to be abetment so as to punish the guilty as per the\\nprovision of penal laws.10. In order to constitute abetment, the abettor must be shown\\nto have \"intentionally\" aided to commission of the crime. Mere proof, that the crime\\ncharged could not have been committed without involvement and/or interposition of\\nthe alleged abettor is not enough compliance with the requirements of section 107. It is\\nnot enough that an act on the part of the alleged abettor happens to facilitate the\\ncommission of the crime.

       " Document(page_content='In typical sting operations, though the operation is carried in the public interest, the\\nsame is generally done by instigating the accused. Hence the victim, who is otherwise\\ninnocent, is lured into committing a crime on the assurance of absolute secrecy and\\nconﬁdentiality of the transaction raising the potential question as to how such a victim\\ncan be held responsible for the crime which he would not have committed but for the\\nenticement. In such circumstances, should the individual, i.e., the sting operator be held\\ncriminally liable for commission of the offence that is inherent and inseparable from\\nthe process by which commission of another offence is sought to be established?\\nWhat about the operator who has mens rea or guilty intention to commit the offence?\\nThese are puzzling questions when there is an allegation that the sting operator is\\nalleged to have committed the abetment of the offence. The Supreme Court in Rajat\\nPrasad v CBI,12. observed that a crime does not stand obliterated or extinguished\\nmerely because its commission is claimed to be in public interest. At the same time,\\nthe criminal intent (mens rea) behind the commission of the act will have to be\\nestablished before the liability of the person charged with the commission of crime can\\nbe adjudged. The Court held that the questions whether the sting operation is a\\njournalistic exercise and any criminal intent can be imputed are to be answered by the\\nevidence of the parties.\\n(1) Abetment by instigation.—First clause.—A person is said to \\'instigate\\' another to an\\nact, when he actively suggests or stimulates him to the act by any means of language,\\ndirect or indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of hints,\\ninsinuation or encouragement.13.\\n[s 107.3] \"Instigate\" Meaning.—\\nInstigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do \"an act\". To\\nsatisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is not necessary that actual words\\nmust be used to that effect or what constitutes \"instigation\" must necessarily and\\nspeciﬁcally be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the\\nconsequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the accused had, by his acts\\nor omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances that the\\ndeceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in which case,\\n\"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a ﬁt of anger or emotion without\\nintending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation. Thus, to\\nconstitute \\'instigation\\', a person who instigates another has to provoke, incite, urge or\\nencourage the doing of an act by the other by \"goading\" or \\'urging forward\\'. The\\ndictionary meaning of the word \"goad\" is \"a thing that stimulates someone into action;\\nprovoke to action or reaction … to keep irritating or annoying somebody until he\\nreacts\".14. The word \"instigate\" literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about\\nby persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or\\nintentional aid as provided in the three clauses of the section.15. Instigate means the\\nactive role played by a person with a view to stimulate another person to do the thing.\\nIn order to hold a person guilty of abetting it must be established that he had\\nintentionally done something which amounted to instigating another to do a thing.16.\\nInstigation may be of an unknown person.17. A mere acquiescence or permission does\\nnot amount to instigation.18.\\n[s 107.4] Wilful misrepresentation or wilful concealment.—\\nExplanation 1 to this section says that a person who (1) by wilful misrepresentation, or\\n(2) by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 393}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure a thing to be done, is said to\\ninstigate the doing of that thing. The illustration is an example of instigation by \\'wilful\\nmisrepresentation\\'. Instigation by \\'wilful concealment\\' is where some duty exists which\\nobliges a person to disclose a fact. The explanation to section 107 says that any wilful\\nmisrepresentation or wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to\\ndisclose, may also come within the contours of \"abetment\".19.\\n[s 107.5] CASES.—Direct instigation.—\\nWhere, of several persons constituting an unlawful assembly, some only were armed\\nwith sticks, and A, one of them, was not so armed, but picked up a stick and used it, B\\n(the master of A), who gave a general order to beat, was held guilty of abetting the\\nassault made by them.20.\\n[s 107.6] Suicide.—\\nAbetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a\\nperson in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or\\naid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.21. Deceased committed\\nsuicide by hanging himself because of alleged illicit relationship between his wife and\\nthe accused. Accused took the wife of deceased away from the house of her brother\\nand kept her with him for four days. There is deﬁnitely a proximity and nexus between\\nthe conduct and behaviour of the accused and wife of deceased with that of suicide\\ncommitted by the deceased.22. Where a married girl committed suicide by burning\\nherself in her in-law\\'s house, her in-laws were held guilty of abetment because they\\nwere persistently torturing her for inadequate dowry and had gone to the extent of\\naccusing her of illegitimate pregnancy.23. \"All these tortures and taunts\", Ray J said,24.\\n\"Caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an\\nend to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her person and setting it aﬁre.\" In another\\ncase of the same kind a husband persistently demanded more money from his wife,\\nquarrelling with her everyday. On the fateful day when she happened to say that death\\nwould have been better than this, she heard only this in reply that her husband would\\nfeel relieved if she ended her life. Immediately thereafter she set herself on ﬁre. The\\nhusband was held guilty of instigating her to commit suicide.25. Mere harassment of\\nwife by husband due to differences per se does not attract section 306 read with\\nsection 107, IPC, 1860.26.\\nDemand of loan amount by accused from deceased itself does not come within the\\nscope of abetment as deﬁned under section 107.27. Goading and intimidating a debtor\\nwith a view to pressurising him for repayment of the loan which brought about a\\nsuicide by the debtor immediately thereafter, was held as not amounting to abetment\\nof suicide and, therefore, no case under section 306 read with section 34 was made\\nout.28.\\nThe accused told the other person \"to go and die\". It was held that this would not in\\nitself satisfy the ingredients of instigation. Instigation has to be with mens rea. The\\nsuicide was committed two days after the quarrel between the accused and the\\ndeceased. This also showed that the suicide was not the direct result of the quarrel.\\nThe suicide note indicated that her husband was a frustrated man and given to drinking\\nand suffered from great stress and depression.29.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 394}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The accused, a Motor Vehicle Inspector, beat up and abused a driver for not being able\\nto produce necessary papers. The driver committed suicide. The Court said that it was\\nnot shown that he was guilty of any act of abetment within the meaning of section 107.\\nThe charge against him under section 107 was quashed.30.\\n[s 107.7] Proof.—\\nIn Chitresh Kumar Chopra v State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi),31. the Supreme Court\\nreiterated the legal position laid down in its earlier three judge bench judgment in the\\ncase of Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,32. and held that where the accused by\\nhis acts or continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased\\nwas left with no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred.\\nIn order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to\\nbe established that:\\n(i)the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful\\nomission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased\\nreacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission\\nor conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward\\ndirection; and\\n(ii)that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased\\nto commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly,\\npresence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.33.\\n[s 107.8] Threats.—\\nMere threats of involving the family in a false and frivolous case cannot be held to\\ntantamount to instigation. By such threats it cannot be held that the accused instigated\\nthe deceased to commit suicide.34.\\n[s 107.9] Test.—\\nNo straight-jacket formula can be laid down to ﬁnd out as to whether in a particular\\ncase there has been instigation which force the person to commit suicide. In a\\nparticular case, there may not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may\\nhave direct nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has to be drawn\\nfrom the circumstances and it is to be determined whether circumstances had been\\nsuch which in fact had created the situation that a person felt totally frustrated and\\ncommitted suicide.35.\\n(2) Abetment by conspiracy.—Second clause.—'Conspiracy' consists in the agreement\\nof two or more [persons] to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means.\\nSo long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to\\ncarry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties,\\npromise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, is\\npunishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.36. It is not\\nnecessary that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.\\nIt is suﬃcient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is\\ncommitted.37. Where parties concert together, and have a common object, the act of\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 395}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='one of the parties, done in furtherance of the common object and in pursuance of the\\nconcerted plan, is the act of all.38.\\nBefore the introduction of Chapter V-A, conspiracy, except in cases provided for by\\nsections 121A, 311, 400, 401 and 402 of the Code, was a mere species of abetment\\nwhen an act or an illegal omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and\\namounted to a distinct offence for each distinct offence abetted by conspiracy.39. For\\nan offence under the second clause of this section a mere combination of persons or\\nagreement is not enough; an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of\\nthe conspiracy. But for an offence under section 120A a mere agreement is enough if\\nthe agreement is to commit an offence.40.\\n[s 107.10] Abetment and Conspiracy-Difference between.—\\nCriminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or\\ncause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal, means. It differs\\nfrom other offences because mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is\\ntaken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with\\nincitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat\\nwider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated under section 107,\\nIPC, 1860.41. There is no analogy between section 120B and section 109, IPC, 1860.\\nThere may be an element of abetment in a conspiracy, but conspiracy is something\\nmore than an abetment. Offences created by sections 109 and 120B, iPC, 1860 are\\nquite distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the prosecution to only one element of\\nconspiracy, that is, abetment when the allegation is that what a person did was\\nsomething over and above that.42.\\n(3) Abetment by aid.—Third clause.—By act.—A person, it is trite, abets by aiding, when\\nby any act done either prior to, or at the time of the commission of an act, he intends to\\nfacilitate and does in fact facilitate the commission thereof, would attract the third\\nclause of section 107 of the IPC, 1860. Doing something for the offender is not\\nabetment. Doing something with knowledge so as to facilitate him to commit the crime\\nor otherwise would constitute abetment.43. In order to constitute abetment by aiding\\nwithin the meaning of the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860 the abettor must be\\nshown to have intentionally aided the commission of the crime. A person may invite\\nanother casually or for a friendly purpose and that may facilitate the murder of the\\ninvitee. But unless it is shown that the invitation was extended with a view to facilitate\\nthe commission of the murder, it cannot be said that the person extending the\\ninvitation had abetted the murder. The language used in the section is \"intentionally\\naids\" and therefore, active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the\\nthird paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860.44. Abetment includes instigating any person\\nto do a thing or engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for the doing of a\\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in\\norder to the doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal omission to the\\ndoing of that thing. On facts held, in the instant case, there was no direct evidence to\\nestablish that the appellant either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide\\nor entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide.45. Where the principal\\noffender killed the victim with a knife provided by the defendant who later claimed that\\nhe thought the knife would be used only to threaten, the defendant\\'s conviction for\\nmurder was upheld, the Court of Appeal saying that the trial judge was correct to direct\\nthe jury that the defendant could be so convicted if he contemplated that the principal\\noffender might kill or cause serious bodily harm to the victim as part of their joint\\nenterprise.46. It is not necessary that the abettor should be present at the place of the\\noccurrence. It is also not necessary to show that the secondary party to a conspiracy to', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 396}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='murder intended the victim to be killed provided it is proved that he contemplated or\\nforesaw the event as a real or substantial risk. Mere absence from the scene of the\\ncrime cannot amount to unequivocal communication of withdrawal from the\\nenterprise. The accused was recruited with certain others by a person to kill his wife. At\\na predetermined time she was taken to the agreed place and killed. The accused was\\nnot present when the killing took place. It was held that he was rightly convicted in that\\nhe had lent encouragement and assistance before the commission of the crime.47.\\n[s 107.11] By illegal omission.—\\nThe deﬁnition of abetment as given in section 107, IPC, 1860 not only includes\\ninstigation but also intentional aiding by an illegal omission.48. A lady advocate was\\nattending the chamber of her senior advocate, the accused. On the day of the incident\\nshe was talking with the accused at her residence. At that moment in his presence, she\\npoured kerosene on her and set herself on ﬁre. The accused did nothing to save her. It\\nwas held that this did not amount to \"illegal omission\". He was held not guilty of\\nabetment of suicide.49.\\n[s 107.12] Abetment of offences under other laws.—\\nThe offence of aiding and abetting is applicable to all statutory offences unless\\nspeciﬁcally excluded by statute and accordingly it was held to apply to offences\\ncreated by the [English] Public Order Act, 1986.50. An abetment of an offence under the\\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 can be made by a non-public servant. Abettors are\\nto be prosecuted through trial under the Prevention of Corruption Act.51.\\n[s 107.13] CASES.—By act.—Presence at bigamous marriage.—\\nMere presence at the scene of a bigamous marriage without any evidence of\\ninstigation aiding or conspiring would not amount to abetment.52. Where the accused\\nheld the antarpat (screen) during the performance of a marriage which he knew was a\\nvoid marriage under section 494, it was held that his act amounted to an act of\\nintentional aid and fell within the purview of the explanation.53.\\n[s 107.14] Presence at exhibition of blue ﬁlm.—\\nWhile entering into the parlour the accused was not aware of the type of ﬁlm under\\nexhibition. Immediately after his entry, the police raided the parlour and charge-sheeted\\nhim as an abettor of offences under sections 292, 293 and 294 because blue ﬁlms\\nwere under exhibition. Following the Supreme Court decision in Shri Ram v State of\\nUP,54. the Court held that something more must be shown than mere presence.\\n[s 107.15] Rape-Abetment.—\\nIn a case of custodial rape, husband and wife, taken into police custody, were kept in\\nseparate rooms.

       " Document(page_content='Explanation 2.—The question regarding abettor\\'s guilt depends on the nature of the act\\nabetted and the manner in which abetment was made. Commission of the act abetted\\nis not necessary for the offence of abetment.61. The offence of abetment is complete\\nnotwithstanding that the person abetted refuses to do the thing, or fails involuntarily in\\ndoing it, or does it and the expected result does not follow. The offence of abetment by\\ninstigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act\\nwhich is actually done by the person whom he abets.\\nExplanation 3.—This explanation makes it clear that the person abetted need not have\\nany guilty intention in committing the act abetted. It applies to abetment generally and\\nthere is nothing to indicate that it applies only to abetment by instigation and not to\\nother kinds of abetment.62. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the\\nperson who abets and not upon the knowledge or intention of the person he employs to\\nact for him.\\nExplanation 4.—This Explanation is to be read as follows: \"When the abetment of an\\noffence is an offence the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence\". In view of\\nExplanation 4 appended under section 108 of the IPC, 1860 the contention of accused\\nthat there cannot be any abetment of an abetment and it is unknown to criminal\\njurisprudence, holds no water and merits no consideration.63.\\n[s 108.1] Abetment of attempt to commit suicide.—\\nSection 306 prescribes punishment for abetment of suicide while section 309 punishes\\nattempt to commit suicide. Abetment of attempt to commit suicide is outside the\\npurview of section 306 and it is punishable only under section 309 and read with\\nsection 107, IPC, 1860.64.\\n[s 108.2] Euthanasia.—\\nAssisted suicide and assisted attempt to commit suicide are made punishable for\\ncogent reasons in the interest of society. Such a provision is considered desirable to\\nalso prevent the danger inherent in the absence of such a penal provision.65. But in\\nAruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,66. the Supreme Court held that passive euthanasia\\ncan be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict monitoring of the\\nCourt.

The leaders who called for revenge were not charge sheeted and\\nthey got off scot-free. Even their names were not revealed as they were political head-\\nweight. Such leaders who prompt the followers to commit crimes should be charge\\nsheeted for abetment of offence for murder.\\n[s 108.4] Abetment is substantive offence.—\\nThe offence of abetment is a substantive one and the conviction of an abettor is,\\ntherefore, in no way dependent on the conviction of the principal.68.

The question of the abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act\\nabetted and the manner in which the abetment was made. Under section 107, IPC,\\n1860 a person abets the doing of an act in either of three ways which can be:\\ninstigating any person to do an act; or engaging with one or more person in any\\nconspiracy for the doing of that act; or intentionally aiding the doing of that act. If a\\nperson instigates another or engages with another in a conspiracy for the doing of an\\nact which is an offence, he abets such an offence and would be guilty of abetment\\nunder section 115 or section 116, IPC, 1860 even if the offence abetted is not\\ncommitted in consequence of the abetment. The offence of abetment is complete\\nwhen the alleged abettor has instigated another or engaged with another in a\\nconspiracy to commit the offence. It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that\\nthe act abetted must be committed. This is clear from Explanation 2 and illustration (a)\\nthereto, to section 108, IPC, 1860. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence\\nby intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment\\nagainst him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the\\noffence is acquitted of that offence.69.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 405}),\n",

B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the\\noffence deﬁned in section 161.\\n(b)A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation,\\ncommits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the\\nsame punishment as B.\\n(c)A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the\\npoison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance\\nof the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes\\nZ's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by\\nconspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.\\nCOMMENTS.—\\nUnder this section the abettor is liable to the same punishment as that which may be\\ninﬂicted on the principal offender, (1) if the act of the latter is committed in\\nconsequence of the abetment, and (2) no express provision is made in the Code for the\\npunishment of such an abetment. Section 109, IPC, 1860 becomes applicable even if\\nthe abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he has\\ninstigated the commission of the offence or has engaged with one or more other\\npersons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to that conspiracy some\\nact or illegal omission takes place or has intentionally aided the commission of an\\noffence by an act or illegal omission.76.\\n[s 109.1] Scope.—\\nThis section lays down nothing more than that if the IPC, 1860 has not separately\\nprovided for the punishment of abetment as such then it is punishable with the\\npunishment provided for the original offence. Law does not require instigation to be in\\na particular form or that it should only be in words. The instigation may be by conduct.\\nWhether there was instigation or not, is a question to be decided on the facts of each\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 408}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='case. It is not necessary in law for the prosecution to prove that the actual operative\\ncause in the mind of the person abetting was instigation and nothing else, so long as\\nthere was instigation and the offence has been committed or the offence would have\\nbeen committed if the person committing the act had the same knowledge and\\nintention as the abettor. The instigation must be with reference to the thing that was\\ndone and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person who is\\ninstigated. It is only if this condition is fulﬁlled that a person can be guilty of abetment\\nby instigation. Further, the act abetted should be committed in consequence of the\\nabetment or in pursuance of the conspiracy as provided in the Explanation to section\\n109. Under the Explanation an act or offence is said to be committed in pursuance of\\nabetment if it is done in consequence of (a) instigation (b) conspiracy or (c) with the\\naid constituting abetment. Instigation may be in any form and the extent of the\\ninﬂuence which the instigation produced in the mind of the accused would vary and\\ndepend upon facts of each case. The offence of conspiracy created under section\\n120A is bare agreement to commit an offence. It has been made punishable under\\nsection 120B. The offence of abetment created under the second clause of section 107\\nrequires that there must be something more than mere conspiracy. There must be\\nsome act or illegal omission in pursuance of that conspiracy. That would be evident by\\nsection 107 (second), \"engages in any conspiracy … for the doing of that thing, if an act\\nor omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy\". The punishment for these two\\ncategories of crimes is also quite different. Section 109, IPC, 1860 is concerned only\\nwith the punishment of abetment for which no express provision has been made in the\\nIPC, 1860. The charge under section 109 should, therefore, be along with charge for\\nmurder which is the offence committed in consequence of abetment. An offence of\\ncriminal conspiracy is, on the other hand, an independent offence. It is made\\npunishable under section 120B for which a charge under section 109 is unnecessary\\nand inappropriate.77. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in\\nconsequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such\\nabetment then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the\\noriginal offence. \"Act abetted\" in section 109 means the speciﬁc offence abetted.\\nTherefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the\\nabetment is normally linked with the proved offence.78. The commission of the offence\\nof rape in a hut then in possession of the accused was held to be not suﬃcient in itself\\nto show that the accused abetted the offence.79.\\n[s 109.2] Distinct offence.—\\nSection 109 is by itself creative of an offence though it is punishable in the context of\\nother offences. The accused was charged under sections 300 and 149. The Court said\\nthat he could not be convicted under section 300 with the aid of section 109. That\\nwould cause great prejudice to the accused in his defence.80. The offence for the\\nabetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the\\nproved offence.81. A plain reading of sections 107–109 of the IPC, 1860 would show\\nthat act complained of in order to amount to abetment has to be committed either prior\\nto or at the time of commission of the offences.82.\\nWhere the appellant, the wife of a co-accused asked the prosecutrix, aged 15 years to\\ngo to the house of the accused and to bring lassi, and when the prosecutrix reached\\nthere, the co-accused, who were two in number, bolted the house from inside and\\ncommitted rape on her, it was held that the appellant was guilty of the offence of\\nabetment. 83.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 409}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 109.3] Failure to prevent is not abetment.—\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that a failure to prevent the commission of an\\noffence is not an abetment of that offence. The Court said:\\nWhere a person aids and abets the perpetrator of a crime at the very time when the crime is\\ncommitted, he is a principal of the second degree and section 109 applies. But mere failure\\nto prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an abetment of that offence.\\nConsidering the deﬁnition in section 109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the\\nthing that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person\\nwho is instigated. It is only if this condition is fulﬁlled that a person can be guilty of\\nabetment by instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not present when the\\noffence abetted is committed provided that he had instigated the commission of the\\noffence or had engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an\\noffence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or\\nintentionally induced the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the\\nabsence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not sustainable. Section 109\\nprovides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no\\nprovision for the punishment of such abetment then the offender is to be punished with the\\npunishment provided for the original offence. Section 109 applies even where the abettor is\\nnot present. Active abetment at the time of committing the offence is covered by section\\n109.\\nThe words 'act abetted' as used in section 109 means the speciﬁc offence abetted. Mere\\nhelp in the preparation for the commission of an offence which is not ultimately committed\\nis not abetment within the meaning of section 109. 'Any offence' in section 109 means\\noffence punishable under IPC or any special or local law. The abetment of an offence under\\nthe special or local law, therefore, is punishable under section 109. For constituting offence\\nof abetment, intentional and active participation by the abettor is necessary.84.\\nWhen a person is charged with the abetment of an offence, it is normally linked with an\\noffence which has been proved.85.\\n[s 109.4] Procedure.—Failure to frame Charge.—\\nSection 109, IPC, 1860 is a distinct offence. Accused having faced trial for being a\\nmember of an unlawful assembly which achieved the common object of killing the\\ndeceased, could in no event be substitutedly convicted for offence under section 302,\\nIPC, 1860 with the aid of section 109, IPC, 1860. There was obviously thus, not only a\\nlegal ﬂaw but also a great prejudice to the appellant in projecting his defence.86.\\nSection 109, IPC, 1860 is by itself an offence though punishable in the context of other\\noffences.87.\\n[s 109.5] Sentence.—\\nWhen the act abetted is committed as a consequence of abetment, the abettor should\\nbe punished with the punishment provided for the main offence with the help of section\\n109, IPC, 1860 and even if a charge under section 120B, IPC, 1860 had been framed, no\\nseparate sentence under that section is called for.88. No distinction should be made in\\nthe quantum of sentence to be awarded to the principal offender and that awarded to\\nthe abettor.89.\\n[s 109.6] Compoundable.—\\nWhen an offence is compoundable under section 320 of the Cr PC, 1973, the abetment\\nof such may be compounded in like manner.90.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 410}),\n",

Instead of the crime being still abetment with circumstances of aggravation, the crime\\nbecomes the very crime abetted. The section is evidently not punitory. Because\\nparticipation de facto. … may sometimes be obscure in detail, it is established by the\\npresumption Juris et de jure that actual presence plus prior abetment can mean nothing else\\nbut participation. The presumption raised by s. 114 brings the case within the ambit of s.\\n34.97.\\nThe meaning of this section is that if the nature of the act done constitutes abetment,\\nthen, if present, the abettor is to be deemed to have committed the offence, though in\\npoint of fact another actually committed it. The abetment must be complete apart from\\nthe mere presence of the abettor.98. The words \"who if absent would be liable to be\\npunished as an abettor\" clearly show that abetment must be one prior to the\\ncommission of the offence and complete by itself.99. Where, for instance, a blow is\\nstruck by A, in the presence of, and by the order of, B, both are principals in the\\ntransaction. If A instigates B to murder, he commits abetment; if absent, he is\\npunishable as an abettor, and if the offence is committed, then under section 109; if\\npresent, he is by this section deemed to have committed the offence and is punishable\\nas a principal.

When more than ten persons are instigated to\\ncommit an offence punishable with death, the offence comes under section 115 as\\nwell as this section.119. Abetment of the commission of murder, whether by a single\\nindividual or by a class of persons exceeding ten, falls under section 115. In the latter\\ncase, it may fall under this section also, but as this section prescribes a lesser\\npunishment, section 115 is the more appropriate provision for such an offence.\\nAlthough both the sections are applicable, there cannot be separate sentences under\\nthe two sections for the same criminal act, and the conviction should properly be under\\nthat section which inﬂicts the higher punishment.120.\\n[s 117.1] Instigation is essential.—\\nA mere intention or preparation to instigate is neither instigation nor abetment. In order\\nto constitute an offence under this section by pasting leaﬂets it is necessary that either\\nthe public should have read the leaﬂets or they should have been exposed to public\\ngaze.121.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 425}),\n",

It came into existence by the\\nCriminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1913. Offence of criminal conspiracy is an exception\\nto the general law where intent alone does not constitute crime. It is intention to\\ncommit crime and joining hands with persons having the same intention.2. Law\\nmaking conspiracy a crime is designed to curb immoderate power to do mischief\\nwhich is gained by a combination of the means. The encouragement and support\\nwhich co-conspirators give to one another rendering enterprises possible which, if left\\nto individual effort, would have been impossible, furnish the ground for visiting\\nconspirators and abettors with condign punishment. The conspiracy is held to be\\ncontinued and renewed as to all its members wherever and whenever any member of\\nthe conspiracy acts in furtherance of the common design. Offence of criminal\\nconspiracy has its foundation in an agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy\\nconsists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or\\nmore to do an unlawful act by unlawful means.3. A criminal conspiracy must be put to\\naction inasmuch as so long a crime is generated in the mind of an accused, it does\\nnot become punishable. What is necessary is not thoughts, which may even be\\ncriminal in character, often involuntary, but offence would be said to have been\\ncommitted thereunder only when that take concrete shape of an agreement to do or\\ncause to be done an illegal act or an act which although not illegal by illegal means\\nand then if nothing further is done the agreement would give rise to a criminal\\nconspiracy.4.\\n[s 120A.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe ingredients of this offence are—', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 432}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(1)that there must be an agreement between the persons who are alleged to\\nconspire; and\\n(2)that the agreement should be\\n(i)for doing of an illegal act, or\\n(ii)for doing by illegal means an act which may not itself be illegal.5.\\nMeeting of minds of two or more persons for doing or causing to be done\\nan illegal act or an act by illegal means is sine qua non of criminal\\nconspiracy.6.\\nThe most important ingredient of the offence being, the agreement between two or\\nmore persons to do an illegal act. In a case where criminal conspiracy is alleged, the\\ncourt must inquire whether the two persons are independently pursuing the same end\\nor they have come together to pursue the unlawful object. The former does not render\\nthem as conspirators but the latter does. For the offence of conspiracy some kind of\\nphysical manifestation of agreement is required to be established. The express\\nagreement need not be proved. The evidence as to the transmission of thoughts\\nsharing the unlawful act is not suﬃcient. A conspiracy is a continuing offence which\\ncontinues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice of necessity.\\nDuring its subsistence whenever any one of the conspirators does an act or series of\\nacts, he would be held guilty under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC,\\n1860).7.\\n[s 120A.2] Elements of Criminal Conspiracy.—\\n(a)an object to be accomplished,\\n(b)a plan or scheme embodying means to accomplish that object,\\n(c)an agreement or understanding between two or more of the accused persons\\nwhereby, they become deﬁnitely committed to cooperate for the\\naccomplishment of the object by the means embodied in the agreement, or by\\nany effectual means, and\\n(d)in the jurisdiction where the statute required an overt act.8.\\n1. Two or more persons needed.—To constitute the offence of conspiracy there must\\nbe an agreement of two or more persons to do an act which is illegal or which is to be\\ndone by illegal means for one cannot conspire with oneself. In Topandas v State of\\nBombay,9. which has been cited by the Supreme Court with approval in Haradhan\\nChakrabarty v UOI,10. it was laid down that \"two or more persons must be parties to\\nsuch an agreement and one person alone can never be held guilty of criminal\\nconspiracy for the simple reason that one cannot conspire with oneself.\" The question\\nof a single person being convicted for an offence of conspiracy was considered in\\nBimbadhar Pradhan v The State of Orissa,11.,12. and held that It is not essential that\\nmore than one person should be convicted of the offence of criminal conspiracy. It is\\nenough if the court is in a position to ﬁnd that two or more persons were actually\\nconcerned in the criminal conspiracy. In the Red fort Attack Case13. the Supreme Court\\nfound that it was nothing but a well-planned conspiracy, in which apart from sole\\nappellant, some others were also involved and convicted the sole appellant for criminal\\nconspiracy.14. Under the common law since husband and wife constitute one person\\nthere cannot be any conspiracy to commit an offence if husband and wife are the only\\nparties to an agreement.15. \"It seems rather odd that though husband and wife by', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 433}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='themselves alone cannot be convicted of an offence of conspiracy for agreeing to\\ncommit an offence but if two of them commit the self-same substantive offence they\\ncan be convicted of that offence\".16. Fortunately this state of law does not exist in\\nIndia, where husband and wife by themselves alone can be parties to a criminal\\nconspiracy. Where the husband is a party with some others in a conspiracy and his wife\\njoined him in that with knowledge that he was involved with others to commit an\\nunlawful act, she would be guilty of the conspiracy.17. Since conspiracy requires at\\nleast two persons, where two or more named persons only were charged and all but\\none of them were acquitted, the remaining accused could not be convicted under\\nsection 120B, IPC, 1860, as he could not have conspired with himself.18. In a similar\\ncase before the Supreme Court, a military major was tried for theft of military goods\\nalong with nine others who were supposed to have abetted him. He was found guilty\\nalong with one more accused and the rest were acquitted. On his appeal, the High\\nCourt quashed the judgment of the Court martial because there was no proof that he\\nhad removed the wheel drums. He was reinstated. In view of the acquittal and\\nreinstatement of the main accused, the matter of his co-accused came before the\\nSupreme Court. He too was ordered to be acquitted and reinstated.19. The same rule\\nobtained under the English common law provided two named persons were tried\\ntogether.20. This rule has now been abolished by section 5(8) of the Criminal Law Act,\\n1977 which provides that unless conviction of one becomes inconsistent with the\\nacquittal of the other even one of the two conspirators can be convicted, e.g., where\\none was acquitted for want of sanction or on ground of being an exempted person. The\\nBombay High Court has taken the same view in a case. Thus, where of the two accused\\none was a public servant and he had to be acquitted as he was prosecuted without\\nobtaining sanction under section 197, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973),\\nthe other could still be convicted on a charge of conspiracy as the acquittal of the other\\naccused was not on facts but on technical ground and in spite of evidence establishing\\nthe factum of conspiracy.21.\\nThe circumstances in which a single person can be tried and convicted have been thus,\\nstated in Kenny:22. \"But though there must be plurality of conspirators, it is not\\nnecessary that all should be brought to trial together. One person may be indicted,\\nalone, for conspiring with other persons who are not in custody, or who are even\\nunknown to the indictors. Indeed, some of the conspirators may be unknown to the\\nrest, provided all are acting under the directions of one leader. There need not be\\ncommunication between each conspirator and every other, provided there be a design\\ncommon to all.\"23. Thus, a wife knowing that her husband was involved with others in a\\nconspiracy, agreed with him that she would join the conspiracy and play her part, it was\\nheld that she thereby became guilty of conspiracy notwithstanding that the only person\\nwith whom she actually concluded the agreement was her husband.24.\\n2. Agreement is gist of the offence.—The gist of the offence is the bare engagement\\nand association to break the law, whether any act be done in pursuance thereof by the\\nconspirators or not.25. Meeting of minds is essential. Mere knowledge or discussion is\\nnot suﬃcient.26. It is intention to commit crime and joining hands with persons having\\nthe same intention. Not only the intention but the presence of an agreement to carry\\nout the object of the intention, is an offence. The question for consideration in a case is\\ndid all the accused had the intention and did they agree that the crime be committed. It\\nwould not be enough for the offence of conspiracy when some of the accused merely\\nentertained a wish, howsoever, horrendous it may be, that offence be committed.27. In\\nthe absence of an agreement, a mere thought to commit a crime does not constitute\\nthe offence.28. The offence of conspiracy is a substantive offence. It renders the mere\\nagreement to commit an offence punishable even if no offence takes place pursuant to\\nthe illegal agreement.29.

       " Document(page_content=\"commit an offence and an agreement of which either the object or the methods\\nemployed are illegal but do not constitute an offence. In the case of the former, the\\ncriminal conspiracy is completed by the act of agreement; in the case of the latter,\\nthere must be some act done by one or more of the parties to the agreement to give\\neffect to the object thereof, that is, there must be an overt act. An express agreement\\nneed not be proved. Evidence relating to transmission of thoughts leading to sharing of\\nthought relating to the unlawful act is suﬃcient.30. A wrong judgment or an inaccurate\\nor incorrect approach or poor management by itself, even after due deliberations\\nbetween Ministers or even with Prime Minister, by itself cannot be said to be a product\\nof criminal conspiracy.31. A few bits here and a few bits there on which the prosecution\\nrelies cannot be held to be adequate for connecting the accused with the commission\\nof the crime of criminal conspiracy. It has to be shown that all means adopted and\\nillegal acts done were in furtherance of the object of conspiracy hatched. The\\ncircumstances relied for the purposes of drawing an inference should be prior in point\\nof time than the actual commission of the offence in furtherance of the alleged\\nconspiracy.32.\\nThe meeting of the minds to form a criminal conspiracy has to be proved by adducing\\nsubstantive evidence, in cases where the circumstantial evidence is incomplete or\\nvague.33.\\n[s 120A.3] Actus reus.—\\nThe actus reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to execute the illegal conduct, not the\\nexecution of it. It is not enough that two or more persons pursued the same unlawful\\nobject at the same time or in the same place; it is necessary to show a meeting of\\nminds, a consensus to give effect to an unlawful purpose. It is not, however, necessary\\nthat each conspirator should have been in communication with every other.34.\\n[s 120A.4] Participation.—\\nIt is not necessary that all the conspirators should participate from the inception to the\\nend of the conspiracy; some may join the conspiracy after the time when such intention\\nwas ﬁrst entertained by any one of them and some others may quit from the\\nconspiracy. All of them cannot be treated as conspirators. Where in pursuance of the\\nagreement the conspirators commit offences individually or adopt illegal means to do\\na legal act which has a nexus to the object of conspiracy, all of them will be liable for\\nsuch offences even if some of them have not actively participated in the commission\\nof those offences.35. To constitute a conspiracy, meeting of mind of two or more\\npersons for doing an illegal act or an act by illegal means is the ﬁrst and primary\\ncondition and it is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every\\ndetail of conspiracy. Neither is it necessary that every one of the conspirators takes\\nactive part in the commission of each and every conspiratorial act.36. Even if some\\nsteps are resorted to by one or two of the conspirators without the knowledge of the\\nothers it will not affect the culpability of those others when they are associated with the\\nobject of the conspiracy.37. The rationale is that criminal acts done in furtherance of a\\nconspiracy may be suﬃciently dependent upon the encouragement and support of the\\ngroup as a whole to warrant treating each member as a causal agent to each act.\\nUnder this view, which of the conspirators committed the substantive offence would be\\nless signiﬁcant in determining the defendant's liability than the fact that the crime was\\nperformed as a part of a larger division of labour to which the accused had also\\ncontributed his efforts.38.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 435}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='[s 120A.5] Overt act.—\\nNo overt act is necessary.39. Where the allegation against the third accused was that\\nhe was merely standing nearby when the other accused committed the murder, he\\ncannot be charged for an offence under sections 302/120B, IPC, 1860, in the absence\\nof any other reliable evidence.40. In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment\\nof an act which by itself constitutes an offence, then in that event, unless the Statute so\\nrequires, no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecution because in such a\\nfact-situation criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement.41.\\nWhen two agree to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and an act of each\\nof the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced,\\nif lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for use of criminal means.42. Where the\\nconspiracy alleged is with regard to the commission of a serious crime as\\ncontemplated by section 120-B read with the proviso to sub-section (2) of section\\n120A, then the mere proof of an agreement is enough to bring about conviction under\\nsection 120B and the proof of any overt act by the accused or by any of them would not\\nbe necessary.43. The illegal act may or may not be done in pursuance of agreement, but\\nthe very agreement is an offence and is punishable.44.\\nIt is not an ingredient of the offence under this section that all the parties should agree\\nto do a single illegal act. It may comprise the commission of a number of acts. Where\\nthe accused are charged with having conspired to do three categories of illegal acts,\\nthe mere fact that all of them could not be convicted separately in respect of each of\\nthe offences has no relevancy in considering the question whether the offence of\\nconspiracy has been committed. They can all be held guilty of the offence of\\nconspiracy to do illegal acts, though for individual offences all of them may not be\\nliable.45. Where the agreement between the accused is a conspiracy to do or continue\\nto do something which is illegal, it is immaterial whether the agreement to do any of\\nthe acts in furtherance of the commission of the offence do not strictly amount to an\\noffence. The entire agreement must be viewed as a whole and it has to be ascertained\\nas to what in fact the conspirators intended to do or the object they wanted to\\nachieve.46. It is not necessary that each member of a conspiracy must know each other\\nor all the details of the conspiracy.47. It is also not necessary that every conspirator\\nmust have taken part in each and every act done in pursuance of a conspiracy.48. It is,\\nhowever, necessary that a charge of conspiracy should contain particulars of the\\nnames of the place or places where it was hatched, persons hatching it, how was it\\nhatched and what the purpose of the conspiracy was.49.\\nIn the matter50. of the assassination of the then Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira\\nGandhi, one of the two actual killers and two conspirators were brought to trial. Both\\nthe conspirators were away from the scene of the crime. One of them was acquitted by\\nthe Supreme Court. His movements after the incident were not properly proved. The\\ndocuments recovered from his custody did not indicate any agreement between him\\nand the other accused. They only showed his agitated mind which was in the grip of an\\navenging mood. This is not enough to establish an agreement with anybody. On the\\nother hand, about Kehar Singh, it was shown that he was having secret talks with one of\\nthe actual killers, that they were trying all the time to keep themselves away from their\\nwives and children, they avoided the company of the other members of the family and\\non being asked what they were talking about, they remained mysterious. These facts\\nwere suﬃcient to show that they were planning something secret. This was enough to\\nconstitute a prima facie evidence of conspiracy within the meaning of section 10 of the\\nEvidence Act, 1872 and to bring them within the jacket of punishment of all for the act\\nof one.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 436}),\n",

Another point of difference is that a single person cannot be convicted under\\nsection 120A and, therefore, where all the accused except one were acquitted, the\\nSupreme Court ordered his acquittal also,64. whereas under section 34, read with some\\nother speciﬁc offence, a single person can be convicted because each is responsible\\nfor the acts of all others.\\n[s 120A.8] Sections 107 and 120A.—\\nFor an offence under this section a mere agreement is enough if the agreement is to\\ncommit an offence. But, for an offence under the second clause of section 107 an act\\nor illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy and a mere\\nagreement is not enough.65.\\n3. How proved (section 120A IPC, 1860 and section 10 Evidence Act, 1872-Doctrine\\nof agency).—There is no difference between the mode of proof of the offence of\\nconspiracy and that of any other offence, it can be established by direct evidence or by\\ncircumstantial evidence. But section 10 of the Evidence Act introduces the doctrine of\\nagency and if the conditions laid down therein are satisﬁed, the acts done by one are\\nadmissible against the coconspirators. When men enter into an agreement for an\\nunlawful end, they become ad-hoc agents for one another and have made a partnership\\nin crime. The said section reads: \"Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two\\nor more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong,\\nanything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to their common', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 438}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='intention, after the time when such intention was ﬁrst entertained by any one of them is\\na relevant fact against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well as for\\nthe purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing\\nthat any such person was party to it.\"\\nThe section can be analysed as follows: \"(1) There shall be a prima facie evidence\\naffording a reasonable ground for a Court to believe that two or more persons are\\nmembers of a conspiracy; (2) if the said condition is fulﬁlled, anything said, done or\\nwritten by any one of them in reference to their common intention will be evidence\\nagainst the other; (3) anything said, done or written by him should have been said, done\\nor written by him after the intention was formed by any one of them; (4) it would also\\nbe relevant for the said purpose against another who entered the conspiracy whether it\\nwas said, done or written before he entered the conspiracy or after he left it; and (5) it\\ncan only be used against a coconspirator and not in his favour.\"66.\\nSince conspiracy is often hatched up in utmost secrecy it is mostly impossible to prove\\nconspiracy by direct evidence. It has, oftener than not, to be inferred from the acts,\\nstatements and conduct of the parties to the conspiracy.67. The circumstances proved\\nbefore, during and after the occurrence have to be considered to decide about the\\ncomplicity of the accused.68. If it is proved that the accused pursued, by their acts, the\\nsame object often by the same means, one performing one part of the act and the\\nother another part of the same act so as to complete it with a view to attainment of the\\nobject which they were pursuing, the Court is at liberty to draw the inference that they\\nconspired together to effect that object.69. It should, however, be remembered that\\nwhere there is no direct evidence, for example through the evidence of an approver, and\\nthe case for the prosecution is dependent on circumstantial evidence alone, it is\\nnecessary for the prosecution to prove and establish such circumstances as would\\nlead to the only conclusion of existence of a criminal conspiracy and rule out the theory\\nof innocence.70. Thus, chairman of a large cooperative society cannot be punished\\nvicariously for the acts of others as mens rea cannot be excluded in a criminal case. As\\na chairman he had to deal with various matters and it would have been impossible for\\nhim to look into every detail to ﬁnd out if someone was committing any criminal breach\\nof trust.71. Similarly, a case of conspiracy to misappropriate cash entrusted to the\\naccused is not made out merely from the audit report without any evidence of shortage\\non actual veriﬁcation of cash as mistakes and even double entries may be made bona\\nﬁde while preparing the account.72. The onus is on the prosecution to prove the charge\\nof conspiracy by cogent evidence, direct or circumstantial.73. One more principle which\\ndeserves notice is that the cumulative effect of the proved circumstances should be\\ntaken into account in determining the guilt of the accused rather than adopting an\\nisolated approach to each of the circumstances. Of course, each one of the\\ncircumstances should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Lastly, in regard to the\\nappreciation of evidence relating to the conspiracy, the Court must take care to see that\\nthe acts or conduct of the parties must be conscious and clear enough to infer their\\nconcurrence as to the common design and its execution.74.\\n[s 120A.9] Inference of conspiracy.—\\nIt is a matter of common experience that direct evidence to prove conspiracy is rarely\\navailable.75. Thus, it is extremely diﬃcult to adduce direct evidence to prove\\nconspiracy. Existence of conspiracy and its objective can be inferred from the\\nsurrounding circumstances and the conduct of the accused. In some cases, indulgence\\nin the illegal act or legal act by illegal means may be inferred from the knowledge\\nitself.76. It can be a matter of inference drawn by the Court after considering whether\\nthe basic facts and circumstances on the basis of which inference is drawn have been', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 439}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='proved beyond all reasonable doubts and that no other conclusion except that of the\\ncomplicity of Accused to have agreed to commit an offence is evident.77. Accordingly,\\nthe circumstances proved before and after the occurrence have to be considered to\\ndecide about the complicity of the accused. Even if some acts are proved to have been\\ncommitted, it must be clear that they were so committed in pursuance of an agreement\\nmade between the accused persons who were parties to the alleged conspiracy.\\nInferences from such proved circumstances regarding the guilt may be drawn only\\nwhen such circumstances are incapable of any other reasonable explanation. An\\noffence of conspiracy cannot be deemed to have been established on mere suspicion\\nand surmises or inference which are not supported by cogent and acceptable evidence.\\nInferences from such proved circumstances regarding the guilt may be drawn only\\nwhen such circumstances are incapable of any other reasonable explanation. To\\nestablish a charge of conspiracy knowledge about indulgence in either an illegal act or\\na legal act by illegal means is necessary. In some cases, intent of unlawful use being\\nmade of the goods or services in question may be inferred from the knowledge\\nitself.78. This apart, the prosecution has not to establish that a particular unlawful use\\nwas intended, so long as the goods or service in question could not be put to any lawful\\nuse. Finally when the ultimate offence consists of a chain of actions, it would not be\\nnecessary for the prosecution to establish, to bring home the charge of conspiracy, that\\neach of the conspirators had the knowledge of what the collaborator would do.79.\\nOne of the accused persons, a foreign national, was found staying in the country\\nwithout valid passport and visa. His movement to various places with the main\\naccused was established. A large quantity of arms and ammunition was recovered\\nfrom the place occupied by the main accused. The Court said that an inference of\\ncriminal conspiracy could be drawn.80. The Court also said that the appeal against\\nconviction of the main accused was dismissed would not be suﬃcient to say that the\\ncharge of conspiracy against other accused would be deemed to be proved.81.\\nCircumstances proved before, during and after the occurrence of the crime have to be\\nconsidered together to decide about the complicity of the accused.82. Circumstantial\\nevidence was based on the recovery of the scooter used by the executant and alleged\\nto have been owned by a co-conspirator, but the recovery was not based on any\\ninformation given by the accused, but by one witness. The Supreme Court held that no\\ncircumstantial evidence was proved against any of the conspirators.83.\\n[s 120A.10] Circumstantial evidence, inference must be backed by evidence.—\\nMost of the circumstances stated as against the accused were not proved. Merely\\nbased on the circumstance that the accused had ﬁled a civil suit against the deceased\\nfor restraining him from doing a business he cannot be convicted. Moreover, there was\\nno speciﬁc evidence as to who the conspirators were, where and when the conspiracy\\nwas hatched, what the speciﬁc purpose of such a conspiracy was and whether it was\\nrelating to the elimination of the deceased.84. The law is well established that\\nconspiracy cannot be proved merely on the basis of inferences. The inferences have to\\nbe backed by evidence.85.\\nThe Court for the purpose of arriving at a ﬁnding as to whether the said offence has\\nbeen committed or not may take into consideration the circumstantial evidence.\\nHowever, while doing so, it must bear in mind that the meeting of minds is essential\\nand mere knowledge or discussion would not be suﬃcient.86.

       " Document(page_content=\"THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\n1.CHAPTER V-A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY\\n[s 120B] Punishment of criminal conspiracy.\\n(1)Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable\\nwith death, 91.[imprisonment for life] or rigorous imprisonment for a term of\\ntwo years or upwards, shall, where no express provision is made in this Code\\nfor the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if\\nhe had abetted such offence.\\n(2)Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy other than a criminal conspiracy to\\ncommit an offence punishable as aforesaid shall be punished with\\nimprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months, or\\nwith ﬁne or with both.]\\nCOMMENT—\\nEarlier to the introduction of sections 120A and B, conspiracy per se was not an\\noffence under IPC, 1860, except in respect of the offence mentioned in section 121A.\\nHowever, abetment by conspiracy was and still remains to be an ingredient of\\nabetment under the second clause of section 107 of IPC, 1860. The punishment\\ntherefore, is provided under various sections, viz., sections 108–117. Whereas under\\nsection 120A, the essence of the offence of criminal conspiracy is a bare agreement to\\ncommit the offence, the abetment under section 107 requires the commission of some\\nact or illegal omission pursuant to the conspiracy.92. Criminal conspiracy is an\\nindependent offence. It is punishable separately.93. The punishment for conspiracy is\\nthe same as if the conspirator had abetted the offence.94. The punishment for a\\ncriminal conspiracy is more severe if the agreement is one to commit a serious\\noffence; it is less severe if the agreement is one to commit an act which although\\nillegal is not an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous\\nimprisonment for more than two years.\\nConspiracy to commit an offence is itself an offence and a person can be separately\\ncharged with respect to such a conspiracy. There may be an element of abetment in a\\nconspiracy; but conspiracy is something more than abetment. The offences created by\\nsection 109 and section 120A are quite distinct and where offences are committed by\\nseveral persons in pursuance of a conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those\\noffences as well as conspiracy to commit those offences.95.\\nThis section applies to those who are the members of the conspiracy during its\\ncontinuance. Conspiracy has to be treated as a continuing offence and whoever is a\\nparty to the conspiracy during the period for which he is charged is liable under this\\nsection.96. A conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to encompass all its\\nmembers wherever and whenever any member of it acts in furtherance of the common\\ndesign.97. The most important ingredient of a criminal conspiracy is an agreement for\\nan illegal act, conspiracy continues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or\\nfrustrated by choice or necessity.98.

       " Document(page_content=\"would get snapped after he is nabbed by the police and kept in custody. He would then\\ncease to be the agent of others. In this case (Rajiv assassination) the prosecution could\\nnot establish that the accused persons who were under detention continued their\\nconspiratorial contact with those who remained outside. A statement which\\nconstitutes prima facie evidence of a conspiracy may amount to an act for which all the\\nmembers can be held liable.99.\\nWhere the accused conspired with others in awarding a contract when he was in job, he\\ncould be held liable for subsequent acts of other conspirators even after his retirement\\nas he contributed his part for furtherance of the conspiracy.100.\\nFor the purpose of establishing or proving the charge of conspiracy, it is not necessary\\nthat there should be knowledge of who are other conspirators and of the detailed\\nstages of the conspiracy. The necessary requisite is knowledge of the main object and\\npurpose of the conspiracy.101. A fraud was alleged to have been committed by\\nGovernment oﬃcers in processing and verifying fake bills. It was held that all the\\noﬃcers who dealt with the relevant ﬁles at one point of time or the other could not be\\nconsidered to have taken part in the conspiracy or that they would be guilty of aiding\\nand abetting the offence. Individual acts of criminal misconduct would have to be\\nconsidered for fastening liability.102.\\nAn accused can be convicted for substantive offence even where he has been\\nacquitted of the charge of conspiracy.103.\\n[s 120B.1] Sanction for prosecution (section 120B IPC, 1860 and section 196\\n(Cr PC, 1973)).—\\nThis section has to be read along with section 196(1-A) (2) (Cr PC, 1973), which\\nrequires previous sanction of the State Government or the District Magistrate to launch\\nprosecution in respect of a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with\\nless than two years imprisonment. Thus, where the object of the conspiracy was\\ncheating by false personation under section 419, IPC, 1860, which is an offence\\npunishable with a three-year imprisonment, the mere fact that there were other non-\\ncognizable offences for which too the accused had been charged would not vitiate the\\ntrial in absence of sanction under section 196(1A)(2), (Cr PC, 1973), as that section is\\nmeant to be applicable to a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit an\\noffence punishable with less than two years' imprisonment.104. Where the act in\\nquestion was not done by the army oﬃcer in the discharge of his oﬃcial duties, it was\\nheld that a sanction for his prosecution was not necessary.105.\\n[s 120B.2] Can a company be prosecuted for Criminal conspiracy.—\\nA corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be convicted\\nof common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring mens rea. The\\ncriminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation\\nto the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its\\naffairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain that the degree and\\ncontrol of the person or body of persons is so intense that a corporation may be said to\\nthink and act through that person or the body of persons.106.\\n[s 120B.3] Signing differently in vakalatnama.—\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 448}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The fact was that the accused put their signatures in vakalatnama differently from their\\noriginal ones. It has been alleged by the complainant that the accused petitioners have\\ndeliberately and wilfully put their signatures on the vakalatnama in collusion with each\\nother like irresponsible persons in order to gain wrongfully and with a view to cheat and\\nmislead the complainant. It was held that the alleged action of the petitioners in\\nsigning their own name on the vakalatnama and ﬁling the same in the Court through\\ntheir counsel is neither an offence nor prohibited by any law. When the alleged act itself\\nwas not illegal, it cannot be said that there was any 'criminal conspiracy' and in\\nabsence of the basis for a charge for criminal conspiracy, the petitioners cannot be\\nprosecuted or punished for the offence under section 120-B of the IPC, 1860.107.\\n[s 120B.4] Seeking opinion.—\\nMerely taking someone's opinion, who is an outsider to litigation, before ﬁling the reply\\nin the Court would not undermine the administration of justice in any way and it is not\\nindicative of criminal conspiracy.108.\\n[s 120B.5] Hooch Tragedy case.—\\nIn a case, the allegation was that all the accused persons hatched a criminal\\nconspiracy and they created a well-oiled machinery for importing methyl alcohol to\\nmake spurious liquor. Accused diluted the spirit by adding water and sold it through\\ntheir outlets. Many persons died due to the consumption of spurious liquor. Some\\npersons lost their eyesight and number of others sustained grievous injuries. Supreme\\nCourt said that the whole business itself was a conspiracy. It may not be the\\nconspiracy to mix the noxious substance but the fact of the matter is that in order to\\nsucceed in the business, which itself was a conspiracy, they mixed or allowed to be\\nmixed methanol and used it so freely that ultimately resulted in the tragedy. Conviction\\nis upheld.109.\\n[s 120B.6] Corruption cases.—\\nThe prosecution asserted that the appellants A1 to A4 had entered into a conspiracy\\nand in furtherance thereof, A1 who was a public servant, had come to possess assets\\nto the tune of Rs. 66.65 crores, disproportionate to her known sources of income,\\nduring the period from 1991 to 1996, when she held the oﬃce of the Chief Minister of\\nthe State. The Supreme Court in respect to the charge of criminal conspiracy observed\\nthat the free ﬂow of money from one account to the other of the respondent's,\\nﬁrms/companies also proved beyond reasonable doubt that all the accused persons\\nhad actively participated in the criminal conspiracy to launder the ill-gotten wealth of\\nA1 for purchasing properties in their names.110.\\n[s 120B.7] Previous sanction.—\\nNo Court shall take cognizance of the offence of any criminal conspiracy punishable\\nunder section 120B of the IPC, 1860, (45 of 1860), other than a criminal conspiracy to\\ncommit an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous\\nimprisonment for a term of two years or upwards, unless the State Government or the\\nDistrict Magistrate has consented in writing to the initiation of the proceeding: Provided\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 449}),\n",

Sentence.—Where the accused is charged both under section 109 as well as section\\n120B, IPC, 1860, and the offence abetted is shown to have been committed as a result\\nof the abetment, the abettor should be punished with the imprisonment provided for\\nthe principal offence under section 109, IPC, 1860, and no separate sentence need be\\nrecorded under section 120B IPC, 1860.112. Where the charge of conspiracy fails, the\\nindividual accused could still be convicted for the offences committed by them and\\nsentenced accordingly.113. Where no jail term was awarded to the principal accused in\\na conspiracy and he was let off with ﬁne alone, it was held that substantive sentence of\\nimprisonment awarded to the other accused was wrongful and, therefore, they also\\nwere ordered to pay ﬁne only.114. Where six of the seven persons accused of criminal\\nconspiracy were acquitted, remaining one accused could not be convicted merely for\\nbeing the head of the section of the branch where fraud was alleged to have been\\ncommitted.115. Where the appellant-accused was one of the active members of the\\ncriminal conspiracy along with other accused and hatched the plan to kill/eliminate the\\ndeceased and in furtherance thereof other accused persons successfully\\nkilled/eliminated the deceased and it was not the case of the appellant-accused and\\nnor was urged also that his case fell under Section 120(2) so as to be awarded less\\nsentence as prescribed therein, the conviction and award of life sentence as prescribed\\nunder Section 302 read with Section 120B, IPC, 1860 was held proper.116. The accused\\npleaded guilty to conspiring to cause a public nuisance. He conspired with others to\\ninterfere with a premier division football match by means of extinguishing the\\nﬂoodlights while the match was in progress. The object of doing so was to affect bets\\nplaced on the match abroad, which depended on the score at the time when the lights\\nwere switched off and the match was abandoned. The plan was not put into effect and\\nthe accused and others were arrested before the match was due to take place. The\\naccused would have received substantial reward for his role. He was sentenced to four\\nyears' imprisonment. His appeal was dismissed. The Court said that the practice of\\ninterfering with such an important sporting ﬁxture was something which should be\\nactively discouraged by severe sentences. The sentence could not be described as\\nmanifestly excessive.117.\\nLaw relating to Conspiracy as summarised by the Supreme Court in State of TN\\nthrough Superintendent of Police, CBI/SIT v Nalini, (AIR 1999 SC 2640 [LNIND 1999 SC\\n1584] : (1999) 5 SCC 253 [LNIND 1999 SC 526] : JT 1999 (4) SC 106 [LNIND 1999 SC\\n526] : 1999 Cr LJ 3124 ).\\n1.Under Section 120A, IPC, 1860, offence of criminal conspiracy is committed\\nwhen two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal\\nact by illegal means. When it is legal act by illegal means overt act is necessary.\\nOffence of criminal conspiracy is exception to the general law where intent alone\\ndoes not constitute crime. It is intention to commit crime and joining hands with\\npersons having the same intention. Not only the intention, but there has to be\\nagreement to carry out the object of the intention, which is an offence. The\\nquestion for consideration in a case is did all the accused had the intention and\\ndid they agree that the crime be committed. It would not be enough for the\\noffence of conspiracy when some of the accused merely entertained a wish,\\nhowsoever, horrendous it may be, that offence be committed.\\n2.Acts subsequent to the achieving of object of conspiracy may tend to prove that\\na particular accused was party to the conspiracy. Once the object of conspiracy\\nhas been achieved, any subsequent act, which may be unlawful, would not make\\nthe accused a part of the conspiracy like giving shelter to an absconder.\\n3.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 450}),\n",

There may be a kind of umbrella-spoke enrolment,\\nwhere a single person at the centre doing the enrolling and all the other members\\nbeing unknown to each other, though they know that there are to be other\\nmembers. These are theories and in practice it may be diﬃcult to tell whether the\\nconspiracy in a particular case falls into which category. It may, however, even\\noverlap. But then there has to be present mutual interest. Persons may be\\nmembers of single conspiracy even though each is ignorant of the identity of\\nmany others who may have diverse role to play. It is not a part of the crime of\\nconspiracy that all the conspirators need to agree to play the same or an active\\nrole.\\n5.When two or more persons agree to commit a crime of conspiracy, then\\nregardless of making or considering any plans for its commission, and despite\\nthe fact that no step is taken by any such person to carry out their common\\npurpose, a crime is committed by each and every one who joins in the\\nagreement. There has thus, to be two conspirators and there may be more than\\nthat. To prove the charge of conspiracy it is not necessary that intended crime\\nwas committed or not. If committed it may further help prosecution to prove the\\ncharge of conspiracy.\\n6.It is not necessary that all conspirators should agree to the common purpose at\\nthe same time. They may join with other conspirators at any time before the\\nconsummation of the intended objective, and all are equally responsible. What\\npart each conspirator is to play may not be known to everyone or the fact as to\\nwhen a conspirator joined the conspiracy and when he left.\\n7.A charge of conspiracy may prejudice the accused because it is forced them into\\na joint trial and the Court may consider the entire mass of evidence against every\\naccused. Prosecution has to produce evidence not only to show that each of the\\naccused has knowledge of object of conspiracy but also of the agreement. In the\\ncharge of conspiracy Court has to guard itself against the danger of unfairness to\\nthe accused. Introduction of evidence against some may result in the conviction\\nof all, which is to be avoided. By means of evidence in conspiracy, which is\\notherwise inadmissible in the trial of any other substantive offence prosecution\\ntries to implicate the accused not only in the conspiracy itself but also in the\\nsubstantive crime of the alleged conspirators. There is always diﬃcult in tracing\\nthe precise contribution of each member of the conspiracy but then there has to\\nbe cogent and convincing evidence against each one of the accused charged\\nwith the offence of conspiracy. As observed to Judge Learned Hand that \"this\\ndistinction is important today when many prosecutors seek to sweep within the\\ndragnet of conspiracy all those who have been associated in any degree\\nwhatever with the main offenders\".\\n8.As stated above it is the unlawful agreement and not its accomplishment, which\\nis the gist or essence of the crime of conspiracy. Offence of criminal conspiracy\\nis complete even though there is no agreement as to the means by which the\\npurpose is to be accomplished. It is the unlawful agreement, which is the\\ngravamen of the crime of conspiracy. The unlawful agreement which amounts to\\na conspiracy need not be formal or express, but may be inherent in and inferred\\nfrom the circumstances, especially declarations, acts and conduct of the\\nconspirators.

Thus, if two or more persons enter into a conspiracy, any act done\\nby any of them pursuant to the agreement is, in contemplation of law, the act of\\neach of them and they are jointly responsible therefor. This means that\\neverything said, written or done by any of the conspirators in execution or\\nfurtherance of the common purpose is deemed to have been said, done, or\\nwritten by each of them. And this joint responsibility extends not only to what is\\ndone by any of the conspirators pursuant to the original agreement but also to\\ncollateral acts incident to and growing out of the original purpose. A conspirator\\nis not responsible, however, for acts done by a co-conspirator after termination of\\nthe conspiracy. The joinder of a conspiracy by a new member does not create a\\nnew conspiracy nor does it change the status of the other conspirators, and the\\nmere fact that conspirators individually or in groups perform different tasks to a\\ncommon end does not split up a conspiracy into several different conspiracies.\\n10.A man may join a conspiracy by word or by deed. However, criminal\\nresponsibility for a conspiracy requires more than a merely passive attitude\\ntowards an existing conspiracy. One who commits an overt act with knowledge\\nof the conspiracy is guilty. And one who tacitly consents to the object of a\\nconspiracy and goes along with other conspirators, actually standing by while\\nthe other but the conspiracy into effect, is guilty though he intends to take no\\nactive part in the crime.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 452}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\n1.CHAPTER V-A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY\\n[s 120A] Deﬁnition of criminal conspiracy.\\nWhen two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done,—\\n(1)an illegal act, or\\n(2)an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a\\ncriminal conspiracy:\\nProvided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall\\namount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is\\ndone by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial whether the illegal act is the ultimate object of such\\nagreement, or is merely incidental to that object.\\nCOMMENT—\\nCriminal conspiracy.—This chapter has introduced into the criminal law of India a new\\noffence, viz., the offence of criminal conspiracy. It came into existence by the\\nCriminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1913. Offence of criminal conspiracy is an exception\\nto the general law where intent alone does not constitute crime. It is intention to\\ncommit crime and joining hands with persons having the same intention.2. Law\\nmaking conspiracy a crime is designed to curb immoderate power to do mischief\\nwhich is gained by a combination of the means. The encouragement and support\\nwhich co-conspirators give to one another rendering enterprises possible which, if left\\nto individual effort, would have been impossible, furnish the ground for visiting\\nconspirators and abettors with condign punishment. The conspiracy is held to be\\ncontinued and renewed as to all its members wherever and whenever any member of\\nthe conspiracy acts in furtherance of the common design. Offence of criminal\\nconspiracy has its foundation in an agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy\\nconsists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or\\nmore to do an unlawful act by unlawful means.3. A criminal conspiracy must be put to\\naction inasmuch as so long a crime is generated in the mind of an accused, it does\\nnot become punishable. What is necessary is not thoughts, which may even be\\ncriminal in character, often involuntary, but offence would be said to have been\\ncommitted thereunder only when that take concrete shape of an agreement to do or\\ncause to be done an illegal act or an act which although not illegal by illegal means\\nand then if nothing further is done the agreement would give rise to a criminal\\nconspiracy.4.\\n[s 120A.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe ingredients of this offence are—\\n(1)that there must be an agreement between the persons who are alleged to', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 455}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='conspire; and\\n(2)that the agreement should be\\n(i)for doing of an illegal act, or\\n(ii)for doing by illegal means an act which may not itself be illegal.5.\\nMeeting of minds of two or more persons for doing or causing to be done\\nan illegal act or an act by illegal means is sine qua non of criminal\\nconspiracy.6.\\nThe most important ingredient of the offence being, the agreement between two or\\nmore persons to do an illegal act. In a case where criminal conspiracy is alleged, the\\ncourt must inquire whether the two persons are independently pursuing the same end\\nor they have come together to pursue the unlawful object. The former does not render\\nthem as conspirators but the latter does. For the offence of conspiracy some kind of\\nphysical manifestation of agreement is required to be established. The express\\nagreement need not be proved. The evidence as to the transmission of thoughts\\nsharing the unlawful act is not suﬃcient. A conspiracy is a continuing offence which\\ncontinues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice of necessity.\\nDuring its subsistence whenever any one of the conspirators does an act or series of\\nacts, he would be held guilty under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC,\\n1860).7.\\n[s 120A.2] Elements of Criminal Conspiracy.—\\n(a)an object to be accomplished,\\n(b)a plan or scheme embodying means to accomplish that object,\\n(c)an agreement or understanding between two or more of the accused persons\\nwhereby, they become deﬁnitely committed to cooperate for the\\naccomplishment of the object by the means embodied in the agreement, or by\\nany effectual means, and\\n(d)in the jurisdiction where the statute required an overt act.8.\\n1. Two or more persons needed.—To constitute the offence of conspiracy there must\\nbe an agreement of two or more persons to do an act which is illegal or which is to be\\ndone by illegal means for one cannot conspire with oneself. In Topandas v State of\\nBombay,9. which has been cited by the Supreme Court with approval in Haradhan\\nChakrabarty v UOI,10. it was laid down that \"two or more persons must be parties to\\nsuch an agreement and one person alone can never be held guilty of criminal\\nconspiracy for the simple reason that one cannot conspire with oneself.\" The question\\nof a single person being convicted for an offence of conspiracy was considered in\\nBimbadhar Pradhan v The State of Orissa,11.,12. and held that It is not essential that\\nmore than one person should be convicted of the offence of criminal conspiracy. It is\\nenough if the court is in a position to ﬁnd that two or more persons were actually\\nconcerned in the criminal conspiracy. In the Red fort Attack Case13. the Supreme Court\\nfound that it was nothing but a well-planned conspiracy, in which apart from sole\\nappellant, some others were also involved and convicted the sole appellant for criminal\\nconspiracy.14. Under the common law since husband and wife constitute one person\\nthere cannot be any conspiracy to commit an offence if husband and wife are the only\\nparties to an agreement.15. \"It seems rather odd that though husband and wife by\\nthemselves alone cannot be convicted of an offence of conspiracy for agreeing to\\ncommit an offence but if two of them commit the self-same substantive offence they\\ncan be convicted of that offence\".16. Fortunately this state of law does not exist in', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 456}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='India, where husband and wife by themselves alone can be parties to a criminal\\nconspiracy. Where the husband is a party with some others in a conspiracy and his wife\\njoined him in that with knowledge that he was involved with others to commit an\\nunlawful act, she would be guilty of the conspiracy.17. Since conspiracy requires at\\nleast two persons, where two or more named persons only were charged and all but\\none of them were acquitted, the remaining accused could not be convicted under\\nsection 120B, IPC, 1860, as he could not have conspired with himself.18. In a similar\\ncase before the Supreme Court, a military major was tried for theft of military goods\\nalong with nine others who were supposed to have abetted him. He was found guilty\\nalong with one more accused and the rest were acquitted. On his appeal, the High\\nCourt quashed the judgment of the Court martial because there was no proof that he\\nhad removed the wheel drums. He was reinstated. In view of the acquittal and\\nreinstatement of the main accused, the matter of his co-accused came before the\\nSupreme Court. He too was ordered to be acquitted and reinstated.19. The same rule\\nobtained under the English common law provided two named persons were tried\\ntogether.20. This rule has now been abolished by section 5(8) of the Criminal Law Act,\\n1977 which provides that unless conviction of one becomes inconsistent with the\\nacquittal of the other even one of the two conspirators can be convicted, e.g., where\\none was acquitted for want of sanction or on ground of being an exempted person. The\\nBombay High Court has taken the same view in a case. Thus, where of the two accused\\none was a public servant and he had to be acquitted as he was prosecuted without\\nobtaining sanction under section 197, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973),\\nthe other could still be convicted on a charge of conspiracy as the acquittal of the other\\naccused was not on facts but on technical ground and in spite of evidence establishing\\nthe factum of conspiracy.21.\\nThe circumstances in which a single person can be tried and convicted have been thus,\\nstated in Kenny:22. \"But though there must be plurality of conspirators, it is not\\nnecessary that all should be brought to trial together. One person may be indicted,\\nalone, for conspiring with other persons who are not in custody, or who are even\\nunknown to the indictors. Indeed, some of the conspirators may be unknown to the\\nrest, provided all are acting under the directions of one leader. There need not be\\ncommunication between each conspirator and every other, provided there be a design\\ncommon to all.\"23. Thus, a wife knowing that her husband was involved with others in a\\nconspiracy, agreed with him that she would join the conspiracy and play her part, it was\\nheld that she thereby became guilty of conspiracy notwithstanding that the only person\\nwith whom she actually concluded the agreement was her husband.24.\\n2. Agreement is gist of the offence.—The gist of the offence is the bare engagement\\nand association to break the law, whether any act be done in pursuance thereof by the\\nconspirators or not.25. Meeting of minds is essential. Mere knowledge or discussion is\\nnot suﬃcient.26. It is intention to commit crime and joining hands with persons having\\nthe same intention. Not only the intention but the presence of an agreement to carry\\nout the object of the intention, is an offence. The question for consideration in a case is\\ndid all the accused had the intention and did they agree that the crime be committed. It\\nwould not be enough for the offence of conspiracy when some of the accused merely\\nentertained a wish, howsoever, horrendous it may be, that offence be committed.27. In\\nthe absence of an agreement, a mere thought to commit a crime does not constitute\\nthe offence.28. The offence of conspiracy is a substantive offence. It renders the mere\\nagreement to commit an offence punishable even if no offence takes place pursuant to\\nthe illegal agreement.29. The object in view or the methods employed should be illegal,\\nas deﬁned in section 43, (supra). A distinction is drawn between an agreement to\\ncommit an offence and an agreement of which either the object or the methods\\nemployed are illegal but do not constitute an offence. In the case of the former, the\\ncriminal conspiracy is completed by the act of agreement; in the case of the latter,', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 457}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"there must be some act done by one or more of the parties to the agreement to give\\neffect to the object thereof, that is, there must be an overt act. An express agreement\\nneed not be proved. Evidence relating to transmission of thoughts leading to sharing of\\nthought relating to the unlawful act is suﬃcient.30. A wrong judgment or an inaccurate\\nor incorrect approach or poor management by itself, even after due deliberations\\nbetween Ministers or even with Prime Minister, by itself cannot be said to be a product\\nof criminal conspiracy.31. A few bits here and a few bits there on which the prosecution\\nrelies cannot be held to be adequate for connecting the accused with the commission\\nof the crime of criminal conspiracy. It has to be shown that all means adopted and\\nillegal acts done were in furtherance of the object of conspiracy hatched. The\\ncircumstances relied for the purposes of drawing an inference should be prior in point\\nof time than the actual commission of the offence in furtherance of the alleged\\nconspiracy.32.\\nThe meeting of the minds to form a criminal conspiracy has to be proved by adducing\\nsubstantive evidence, in cases where the circumstantial evidence is incomplete or\\nvague.33.\\n[s 120A.3] Actus reus.—\\nThe actus reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to execute the illegal conduct, not the\\nexecution of it. It is not enough that two or more persons pursued the same unlawful\\nobject at the same time or in the same place; it is necessary to show a meeting of\\nminds, a consensus to give effect to an unlawful purpose. It is not, however, necessary\\nthat each conspirator should have been in communication with every other.34.\\n[s 120A.4] Participation.—\\nIt is not necessary that all the conspirators should participate from the inception to the\\nend of the conspiracy; some may join the conspiracy after the time when such intention\\nwas ﬁrst entertained by any one of them and some others may quit from the\\nconspiracy. All of them cannot be treated as conspirators. Where in pursuance of the\\nagreement the conspirators commit offences individually or adopt illegal means to do\\na legal act which has a nexus to the object of conspiracy, all of them will be liable for\\nsuch offences even if some of them have not actively participated in the commission\\nof those offences.35. To constitute a conspiracy, meeting of mind of two or more\\npersons for doing an illegal act or an act by illegal means is the ﬁrst and primary\\ncondition and it is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every\\ndetail of conspiracy. Neither is it necessary that every one of the conspirators takes\\nactive part in the commission of each and every conspiratorial act.36. Even if some\\nsteps are resorted to by one or two of the conspirators without the knowledge of the\\nothers it will not affect the culpability of those others when they are associated with the\\nobject of the conspiracy.37. The rationale is that criminal acts done in furtherance of a\\nconspiracy may be suﬃciently dependent upon the encouragement and support of the\\ngroup as a whole to warrant treating each member as a causal agent to each act.\\nUnder this view, which of the conspirators committed the substantive offence would be\\nless signiﬁcant in determining the defendant's liability than the fact that the crime was\\nperformed as a part of a larger division of labour to which the accused had also\\ncontributed his efforts.38.\\n[s 120A.5] Overt act.—\\nNo overt act is necessary.39. Where the allegation against the third accused was that\\nhe was merely standing nearby when the other accused committed the murder, he\\ncannot be charged for an offence under sections 302/120B, IPC, 1860, in the absence\\nof any other reliable evidence.40. In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 458}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of an act which by itself constitutes an offence, then in that event, unless the Statute so\\nrequires, no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecution because in such a\\nfact-situation criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement.41.\\nWhen two agree to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and an act of each\\nof the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced,\\nif lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for use of criminal means.42. Where the\\nconspiracy alleged is with regard to the commission of a serious crime as\\ncontemplated by section 120-B read with the proviso to sub-section (2) of section\\n120A, then the mere proof of an agreement is enough to bring about conviction under\\nsection 120B and the proof of any overt act by the accused or by any of them would not\\nbe necessary.43. The illegal act may or may not be done in pursuance of agreement, but\\nthe very agreement is an offence and is punishable.44.\\nIt is not an ingredient of the offence under this section that all the parties should agree\\nto do a single illegal act. It may comprise the commission of a number of acts. Where\\nthe accused are charged with having conspired to do three categories of illegal acts,\\nthe mere fact that all of them could not be convicted separately in respect of each of\\nthe offences has no relevancy in considering the question whether the offence of\\nconspiracy has been committed. They can all be held guilty of the offence of\\nconspiracy to do illegal acts, though for individual offences all of them may not be\\nliable.45. Where the agreement between the accused is a conspiracy to do or continue\\nto do something which is illegal, it is immaterial whether the agreement to do any of\\nthe acts in furtherance of the commission of the offence do not strictly amount to an\\noffence. The entire agreement must be viewed as a whole and it has to be ascertained\\nas to what in fact the conspirators intended to do or the object they wanted to\\nachieve.46. It is not necessary that each member of a conspiracy must know each other\\nor all the details of the conspiracy.47. It is also not necessary that every conspirator\\nmust have taken part in each and every act done in pursuance of a conspiracy.48. It is,\\nhowever, necessary that a charge of conspiracy should contain particulars of the\\nnames of the place or places where it was hatched, persons hatching it, how was it\\nhatched and what the purpose of the conspiracy was.49.\\nIn the matter50. of the assassination of the then Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira\\nGandhi, one of the two actual killers and two conspirators were brought to trial. Both\\nthe conspirators were away from the scene of the crime. One of them was acquitted by\\nthe Supreme Court. His movements after the incident were not properly proved. The\\ndocuments recovered from his custody did not indicate any agreement between him\\nand the other accused. They only showed his agitated mind which was in the grip of an\\navenging mood. This is not enough to establish an agreement with anybody. On the\\nother hand, about Kehar Singh, it was shown that he was having secret talks with one of\\nthe actual killers, that they were trying all the time to keep themselves away from their\\nwives and children, they avoided the company of the other members of the family and\\non being asked what they were talking about, they remained mysterious. These facts\\nwere suﬃcient to show that they were planning something secret. This was enough to\\nconstitute a prima facie evidence of conspiracy within the meaning of section 10 of the\\nEvidence Act, 1872 and to bring them within the jacket of punishment of all for the act\\nof one.\\nPrivacy and secrecy are more characteristics of a conspiracy, than of a loud discussion\\nin an elevated place open to public view. Direct evidence in proof of a conspiracy is\\nseldom available; offence of conspiracy can be proved by either direct or circumstantial\\nevidence. It is not always possible to give aﬃrmative evidence about the date of the\\nformation of the criminal conspiracy, about the persons who took part in the formation\\nof the conspiracy, about the object, which the objectors set before themselves as the\\nobject of conspiracy, and about the manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be\\ncarried out, all this is necessarily a matter of inference.51. Thus, a conspiracy is an', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 459}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"inference from circumstances. There cannot always be much direct evidence about it.\\nConspiracy can be inferred even from the circumstances giving rise to a conclusive or\\nirresistible inference of an agreement between two or more persons to commit an\\noffence.52. It is manifest that the meeting of minds of two or more persons is a sine\\nqua non but it may not be possible to establish by direct evidence. Its existence and\\nobjective can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and parties conduct. It is\\nnecessary that the incriminating circumstances must form a chain of events, from\\nwhich a conclusion about the accused's guilt could be drawn. The help of\\ncircumstantial evidence is necessary because a conspiracy is always hatched in\\nsecrecy. It becomes diﬃcult to locate any direct evidence.53. A businessman was in\\ngreat need of money for completing the construction of a theatre complex. He was\\napproached by a person who told him that his ﬁnancier friend would help him with\\nmoney. This was followed by a number of meetings between him and the team of\\nﬁnanciers during which documents were executed and money released in cash which\\ncash was found to be counterfeit currency. Every member of the team was held to be\\nguilty of conspiracy and of cheating under section 420.54. Seizure of unexplained\\ncurrency notes from the possession of a person who claimed to be the owner of the\\nmoney was held to be not suﬃcient to connect him with the person who was the main\\naccused of smuggling currency, though he was a relative of the main accused.55.\\nWhere a bank accountant dishonestly agreed with others to conceal dishonour of\\ncheques purchased by the bank and thus, causing risk to the economic interests of the\\nbank, he was held guilty of conspiring to defraud whatever his motive or underlying\\npurpose might have been (he contended that he acted in the interest of the bank) and\\neven though he had no desire to harm the victim and no loss was actually caused.56.\\nOﬃcials of a nationalised bank, in violation of departmental instructions, allowing\\nadvance credits on banker's cheques to the account of a customer dealing in\\nsecurities. Advance credits were allowed before the cheques were sent for clearance\\nand in some cases even before the cheques were received. This allowed the customer\\nto take pecuniary advantage by overdrawing money from his account which he was not\\nentitled to. Public funds were thus, misused. It was held that a criminal conspiracy\\nbetween bank oﬃcials and the customer stood proved. One of them was acquitted\\nbecause no conclusive evidence could be found against him.57.\\nA criminal conspiracy can be proved by circumstantial evidence or by necessary\\nimplication. A smaller conspiracy may be the part of a larger conspiracy. It was held on\\nfacts that a criminal conspiracy was established when oﬃcials of two public sector\\nbanks acted in such a way that the transaction appeared to be an inter-banking\\ntransaction relating to call money which the borrowing bank was supposed to retain\\nwith itself but the transaction was in fact meant to help a private party to use public\\nfunds for private purpose.58. Where the accused, an LIC agent, was charged with\\ncheating the LIC by entering into conspiracy with the co-accused, a Development\\nOﬃcer, on the allegation that insurance policies were got issued on the basis of fake\\nand forged documents and he received premium commission and bonus in respect of\\nthose policies, the accused was entitled to be acquitted because the forging was done\\nby the co-accused without the knowledge and consent of the accused. Bonus,\\nCommission, etc., in respect of those policies were credited to his account only in the\\nnormal course.59. A 'vaid' and an 'up-vaid' who, in conspiracy with others made bogus\\nmedical bills for government servants and got them duly passed through their\\nAyurvedic Aushadhalaya for payment of 30 per cent of the amount of the bills, were\\ncaught in a trap and the tainted money was recovered from the accused. One of the\\naccused died during the pendency of appeal. Conviction of the other under sections\\n120B/468 was held to be proper.60.\\nA group of friends went to a club for fun and frolic.

       " Document(page_content='of the accused carrying a loaded pistol. They had stayed at the club for about two and\\na half hours. The Court said that this could not constitute an evidence of conspiracy.\\nThe Court also said that the fact that the group members dispersed separately and\\nalso helped to retrieve the murder weapon would not suggest conspiracy for murder.61.\\n[s 120A.6] Same verdict in respect of each not necessary.—\\nIt has been held that the rule that both parties to a conspiracy had to be convicted or\\nacquitted has been abrogated by the Criminal Law Act, 1977 (English). The important\\nquestion is whether there is a material difference in the evidence against the two.62.\\n[s 120A.7] Sections 34 and 120A.—\\nThere is not much substantial difference between conspiracy as deﬁned in section\\n120A and acting on a common intention, as contemplated in section 34. While in the\\nformer, the gist of the offence is bare engagement and association to break the law\\neven though the illegal act does not follow, the gist of the offence under section 34 is\\nthe commission of a criminal act in furtherance of a common intention of all the\\noffenders, which means that there should be unity of criminal behaviour resulting in\\nsomething, for which an individual would be punishable, if it were all done by himself\\nalone.63. Another point of difference is that a single person cannot be convicted under\\nsection 120A and, therefore, where all the accused except one were acquitted, the\\nSupreme Court ordered his acquittal also,64. whereas under section 34, read with some\\nother speciﬁc offence, a single person can be convicted because each is responsible\\nfor the acts of all others.\\n[s 120A.8] Sections 107 and 120A.—\\nFor an offence under this section a mere agreement is enough if the agreement is to\\ncommit an offence. But, for an offence under the second clause of section 107 an act\\nor illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy and a mere\\nagreement is not enough.65.\\n3. How proved (section 120A IPC, 1860 and section 10 Evidence Act, 1872-Doctrine\\nof agency).—There is no difference between the mode of proof of the offence of\\nconspiracy and that of any other offence, it can be established by direct evidence or by\\ncircumstantial evidence. But section 10 of the Evidence Act introduces the doctrine of\\nagency and if the conditions laid down therein are satisﬁed, the acts done by one are\\nadmissible against the coconspirators. When men enter into an agreement for an\\nunlawful end, they become ad-hoc agents for one another and have made a partnership\\nin crime. The said section reads: \"Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two\\nor more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong,\\nanything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to their common\\nintention, after the time when such intention was ﬁrst entertained by any one of them is\\na relevant fact against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well as for\\nthe purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing\\nthat any such person was party to it.\"\\nThe section can be analysed as follows: \"(1) There shall be a prima facie evidence\\naffording a reasonable ground for a Court to believe that two or more persons are\\nmembers of a conspiracy; (2) if the said condition is fulﬁlled, anything said, done or\\nwritten by any one of them in reference to their common intention will be evidence\\nagainst the other; (3) anything said, done or written by him should have been said, done\\nor written by him after the intention was formed by any one of them; (4) it would also\\nbe relevant for the said purpose against another who entered the conspiracy whether it\\nwas said, done or written before he entered the conspiracy or after he left it; and (5) it\\ncan only be used against a coconspirator and not in his favour.\"66.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 461}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Since conspiracy is often hatched up in utmost secrecy it is mostly impossible to prove\\nconspiracy by direct evidence. It has, oftener than not, to be inferred from the acts,\\nstatements and conduct of the parties to the conspiracy.67. The circumstances proved\\nbefore, during and after the occurrence have to be considered to decide about the\\ncomplicity of the accused.68. If it is proved that the accused pursued, by their acts, the\\nsame object often by the same means, one performing one part of the act and the\\nother another part of the same act so as to complete it with a view to attainment of the\\nobject which they were pursuing, the Court is at liberty to draw the inference that they\\nconspired together to effect that object.69. It should, however, be remembered that\\nwhere there is no direct evidence, for example through the evidence of an approver, and\\nthe case for the prosecution is dependent on circumstantial evidence alone, it is\\nnecessary for the prosecution to prove and establish such circumstances as would\\nlead to the only conclusion of existence of a criminal conspiracy and rule out the theory\\nof innocence.70. Thus, chairman of a large cooperative society cannot be punished\\nvicariously for the acts of others as mens rea cannot be excluded in a criminal case. As\\na chairman he had to deal with various matters and it would have been impossible for\\nhim to look into every detail to ﬁnd out if someone was committing any criminal breach\\nof trust.71. Similarly, a case of conspiracy to misappropriate cash entrusted to the\\naccused is not made out merely from the audit report without any evidence of shortage\\non actual veriﬁcation of cash as mistakes and even double entries may be made bona\\nﬁde while preparing the account.72. The onus is on the prosecution to prove the charge\\nof conspiracy by cogent evidence, direct or circumstantial.73. One more principle which\\ndeserves notice is that the cumulative effect of the proved circumstances should be\\ntaken into account in determining the guilt of the accused rather than adopting an\\nisolated approach to each of the circumstances. Of course, each one of the\\ncircumstances should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Lastly, in regard to the\\nappreciation of evidence relating to the conspiracy, the Court must take care to see that\\nthe acts or conduct of the parties must be conscious and clear enough to infer their\\nconcurrence as to the common design and its execution.74.\\n[s 120A.9] Inference of conspiracy.—\\nIt is a matter of common experience that direct evidence to prove conspiracy is rarely\\navailable.75. Thus, it is extremely diﬃcult to adduce direct evidence to prove\\nconspiracy. Existence of conspiracy and its objective can be inferred from the\\nsurrounding circumstances and the conduct of the accused. In some cases, indulgence\\nin the illegal act or legal act by illegal means may be inferred from the knowledge\\nitself.76. It can be a matter of inference drawn by the Court after considering whether\\nthe basic facts and circumstances on the basis of which inference is drawn have been\\nproved beyond all reasonable doubts and that no other conclusion except that of the\\ncomplicity of Accused to have agreed to commit an offence is evident.77. Accordingly,\\nthe circumstances proved before and after the occurrence have to be considered to\\ndecide about the complicity of the accused. Even if some acts are proved to have been\\ncommitted, it must be clear that they were so committed in pursuance of an agreement\\nmade between the accused persons who were parties to the alleged conspiracy.\\nInferences from such proved circumstances regarding the guilt may be drawn only\\nwhen such circumstances are incapable of any other reasonable explanation. An\\noffence of conspiracy cannot be deemed to have been established on mere suspicion\\nand surmises or inference which are not supported by cogent and acceptable evidence.\\nInferences from such proved circumstances regarding the guilt may be drawn only\\nwhen such circumstances are incapable of any other reasonable explanation. To\\nestablish a charge of conspiracy knowledge about indulgence in either an illegal act or\\na legal act by illegal means is necessary.

Finally when the ultimate offence consists of a chain of actions, it would not be\\nnecessary for the prosecution to establish, to bring home the charge of conspiracy, that\\neach of the conspirators had the knowledge of what the collaborator would do.79.\\nOne of the accused persons, a foreign national, was found staying in the country\\nwithout valid passport and visa. His movement to various places with the main\\naccused was established. A large quantity of arms and ammunition was recovered\\nfrom the place occupied by the main accused. The Court said that an inference of\\ncriminal conspiracy could be drawn.80. The Court also said that the appeal against\\nconviction of the main accused was dismissed would not be suﬃcient to say that the\\ncharge of conspiracy against other accused would be deemed to be proved.81.\\nCircumstances proved before, during and after the occurrence of the crime have to be\\nconsidered together to decide about the complicity of the accused.82. Circumstantial\\nevidence was based on the recovery of the scooter used by the executant and alleged\\nto have been owned by a co-conspirator, but the recovery was not based on any\\ninformation given by the accused, but by one witness. The Supreme Court held that no\\ncircumstantial evidence was proved against any of the conspirators.83.\\n[s 120A.10] Circumstantial evidence, inference must be backed by evidence.—\\nMost of the circumstances stated as against the accused were not proved. Merely\\nbased on the circumstance that the accused had ﬁled a civil suit against the deceased\\nfor restraining him from doing a business he cannot be convicted. Moreover, there was\\nno speciﬁc evidence as to who the conspirators were, where and when the conspiracy\\nwas hatched, what the speciﬁc purpose of such a conspiracy was and whether it was\\nrelating to the elimination of the deceased.84. The law is well established that\\nconspiracy cannot be proved merely on the basis of inferences. The inferences have to\\nbe backed by evidence.85.\\nThe Court for the purpose of arriving at a ﬁnding as to whether the said offence has\\nbeen committed or not may take into consideration the circumstantial evidence.\\nHowever, while doing so, it must bear in mind that the meeting of minds is essential\\nand mere knowledge or discussion would not be suﬃcient.86. In Mukesh v State for\\nNCT of Delhi, Criminal Appeal Nos. 607–608 of 2017, (popular as Nirbhaya Case) the\\ncriminal conspiracy was proved by the sequence of events and the conduct of the\\naccused.\\nIn the conspiracy for assassination of the former PM (Rajiv Gandhi) one of the accused\\npersons at one point of time in his confessional statement said that he had a strong\\nsuspicion that Rajiv Gandhi was the target of the accused persons. The Court said that\\nthis suspicion did not make him a member of the conspiracy. His association, however\\nstrong with the main conspirators would not make him a member of the conspiracy by\\nitself. But those who were in the thick of the conspiracy, for example, one who\\npurchased the battery for explosion of human body, their conviction for the main\\noffence was proper. But mere association with LTTE was not suﬃcient nor the fact that\\nmessages about arrests were sent by certain persons.87.\\n[s 120A.11] Contacts through telephone.—\\nWhere the case against the appellants A2 to A4 is that they had hatched a conspiracy\\nwith appellant A1 to kill the deceased and the case against A1 was proved as per the\\n'last seen theory', and to prove the conspiracy the prosecution relied on the\\ncircumstance that there were frequent phone calls among the accused some days\\naround the date of murder, and the recovery of some vehicles; the Supreme Court held\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 463}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\n1.CHAPTER V-A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY\\n[s 120B] Punishment of criminal conspiracy.\\n(1)Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable\\nwith death, 91.[imprisonment for life] or rigorous imprisonment for a term of\\ntwo years or upwards, shall, where no express provision is made in this Code\\nfor the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if\\nhe had abetted such offence.\\n(2)Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy other than a criminal conspiracy to\\ncommit an offence punishable as aforesaid shall be punished with\\nimprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months, or\\nwith ﬁne or with both.]\\nCOMMENT—\\nEarlier to the introduction of sections 120A and B, conspiracy per se was not an\\noffence under IPC, 1860, except in respect of the offence mentioned in section 121A.\\nHowever, abetment by conspiracy was and still remains to be an ingredient of\\nabetment under the second clause of section 107 of IPC, 1860. The punishment\\ntherefore, is provided under various sections, viz., sections 108–117. Whereas under\\nsection 120A, the essence of the offence of criminal conspiracy is a bare agreement to\\ncommit the offence, the abetment under section 107 requires the commission of some\\nact or illegal omission pursuant to the conspiracy.92. Criminal conspiracy is an\\nindependent offence. It is punishable separately.93. The punishment for conspiracy is\\nthe same as if the conspirator had abetted the offence.94. The punishment for a\\ncriminal conspiracy is more severe if the agreement is one to commit a serious\\noffence; it is less severe if the agreement is one to commit an act which although\\nillegal is not an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous\\nimprisonment for more than two years.\\nConspiracy to commit an offence is itself an offence and a person can be separately\\ncharged with respect to such a conspiracy. There may be an element of abetment in a\\nconspiracy; but conspiracy is something more than abetment. The offences created by\\nsection 109 and section 120A are quite distinct and where offences are committed by\\nseveral persons in pursuance of a conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those\\noffences as well as conspiracy to commit those offences.95.\\nThis section applies to those who are the members of the conspiracy during its\\ncontinuance. Conspiracy has to be treated as a continuing offence and whoever is a\\nparty to the conspiracy during the period for which he is charged is liable under this\\nsection.96. A conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to encompass all its\\nmembers wherever and whenever any member of it acts in furtherance of the common\\ndesign.97. The most important ingredient of a criminal conspiracy is an agreement for\\nan illegal act, conspiracy continues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or\\nfrustrated by choice or necessity.98.

In this case (Rajiv assassination) the prosecution could\\nnot establish that the accused persons who were under detention continued their\\nconspiratorial contact with those who remained outside. A statement which\\nconstitutes prima facie evidence of a conspiracy may amount to an act for which all the\\nmembers can be held liable.99.\\nWhere the accused conspired with others in awarding a contract when he was in job, he\\ncould be held liable for subsequent acts of other conspirators even after his retirement\\nas he contributed his part for furtherance of the conspiracy.100.\\nFor the purpose of establishing or proving the charge of conspiracy, it is not necessary\\nthat there should be knowledge of who are other conspirators and of the detailed\\nstages of the conspiracy. The necessary requisite is knowledge of the main object and\\npurpose of the conspiracy.101. A fraud was alleged to have been committed by\\nGovernment oﬃcers in processing and verifying fake bills. It was held that all the\\noﬃcers who dealt with the relevant ﬁles at one point of time or the other could not be\\nconsidered to have taken part in the conspiracy or that they would be guilty of aiding\\nand abetting the offence. Individual acts of criminal misconduct would have to be\\nconsidered for fastening liability.102.\\nAn accused can be convicted for substantive offence even where he has been\\nacquitted of the charge of conspiracy.103.\\n[s 120B.1] Sanction for prosecution (section 120B IPC, 1860 and section 196 (Cr PC,\\n1973)).—\\nThis section has to be read along with section 196(1-A) (2) (Cr PC, 1973), which\\nrequires previous sanction of the State Government or the District Magistrate to launch\\nprosecution in respect of a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with\\nless than two years imprisonment. Thus, where the object of the conspiracy was\\ncheating by false personation under section 419, IPC, 1860, which is an offence\\npunishable with a three-year imprisonment, the mere fact that there were other non-\\ncognizable offences for which too the accused had been charged would not vitiate the\\ntrial in absence of sanction under section 196(1A)(2), (Cr PC, 1973), as that section is\\nmeant to be applicable to a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit an\\noffence punishable with less than two years' imprisonment.104. Where the act in\\nquestion was not done by the army oﬃcer in the discharge of his oﬃcial duties, it was\\nheld that a sanction for his prosecution was not necessary.105.\\n[s 120B.2] Can a company be prosecuted for Criminal conspiracy.—\\nA corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be convicted\\nof common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring mens rea. The\\ncriminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation\\nto the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its\\naffairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain that the degree and\\ncontrol of the person or body of persons is so intense that a corporation may be said to\\nthink and act through that person or the body of persons.106.\\n[s 120B.3] Signing differently in vakalatnama.—\\nThe fact was that the accused put their signatures in vakalatnama differently from their\\noriginal ones. It has been alleged by the complainant that the accused petitioners have\\ndeliberately and wilfully put their signatures on the vakalatnama in collusion with each\\nother like irresponsible persons in order to gain wrongfully and with a view to cheat and\\nmislead the complainant.

Accused diluted the spirit by adding water and sold it through\\ntheir outlets. Many persons died due to the consumption of spurious liquor. Some\\npersons lost their eyesight and number of others sustained grievous injuries. Supreme\\nCourt said that the whole business itself was a conspiracy. It may not be the\\nconspiracy to mix the noxious substance but the fact of the matter is that in order to\\nsucceed in the business, which itself was a conspiracy, they mixed or allowed to be\\nmixed methanol and used it so freely that ultimately resulted in the tragedy. Conviction\\nis upheld.109.\\n[s 120B.6] Corruption cases.—\\nThe prosecution asserted that the appellants A1 to A4 had entered into a conspiracy\\nand in furtherance thereof, A1 who was a public servant, had come to possess assets\\nto the tune of Rs. 66.65 crores, disproportionate to her known sources of income,\\nduring the period from 1991 to 1996, when she held the oﬃce of the Chief Minister of\\nthe State. The Supreme Court in respect to the charge of criminal conspiracy observed\\nthat the free ﬂow of money from one account to the other of the respondent's,\\nﬁrms/companies also proved beyond reasonable doubt that all the accused persons\\nhad actively participated in the criminal conspiracy to launder the ill-gotten wealth of\\nA1 for purchasing properties in their names.110.\\n[s 120B.7] Previous sanction.—\\nNo Court shall take cognizance of the offence of any criminal conspiracy punishable\\nunder section 120B of the IPC, 1860, (45 of 1860), other than a criminal conspiracy to\\ncommit an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous\\nimprisonment for a term of two years or upwards, unless the State Government or the\\nDistrict Magistrate has consented in writing to the initiation of the proceeding: Provided\\nthat where the criminal conspiracy is one to which the provisions of section 195 apply,\\nno such consent shall be necessary.111.\\n2. Sentence.—Where the accused is charged both under section 109 as well as section\\n120B, IPC, 1860, and the offence abetted is shown to have been committed as a result\\nof the abetment, the abettor should be punished with the imprisonment provided for\\nthe principal offence under section 109, IPC, 1860, and no separate sentence need be\\nrecorded under section 120B IPC, 1860.112. Where the charge of conspiracy fails, the\\nindividual accused could still be convicted for the offences committed by them and\\nsentenced accordingly.113. Where no jail term was awarded to the principal accused in\\na conspiracy and he was let off with ﬁne alone, it was held that substantive sentence of\\nimprisonment awarded to the other accused was wrongful and, therefore, they also\\nwere ordered to pay ﬁne only.114.

The accused\\npleaded guilty to conspiring to cause a public nuisance. He conspired with others to\\ninterfere with a premier division football match by means of extinguishing the\\nﬂoodlights while the match was in progress. The object of doing so was to affect bets\\nplaced on the match abroad, which depended on the score at the time when the lights\\nwere switched off and the match was abandoned. The plan was not put into effect and\\nthe accused and others were arrested before the match was due to take place. The\\naccused would have received substantial reward for his role. He was sentenced to four\\nyears' imprisonment. His appeal was dismissed. The Court said that the practice of\\ninterfering with such an important sporting ﬁxture was something which should be\\nactively discouraged by severe sentences. The sentence could not be described as\\nmanifestly excessive.117.\\nLaw relating to Conspiracy as summarised by the Supreme Court in State of TN\\nthrough Superintendent of Police, CBI/SIT v Nalini, (AIR 1999 SC 2640 [LNIND 1999 SC\\n1584] : (1999) 5 SCC 253 [LNIND 1999 SC 526] : JT 1999 (4) SC 106 [LNIND 1999 SC\\n526] : 1999 Cr LJ 3124 ).\\n1.Under Section 120A, IPC, 1860, offence of criminal conspiracy is committed\\nwhen two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal\\nact by illegal means. When it is legal act by illegal means overt act is necessary.\\nOffence of criminal conspiracy is exception to the general law where intent alone\\ndoes not constitute crime. It is intention to commit crime and joining hands with\\npersons having the same intention. Not only the intention, but there has to be\\nagreement to carry out the object of the intention, which is an offence. The\\nquestion for consideration in a case is did all the accused had the intention and\\ndid they agree that the crime be committed. It would not be enough for the\\noffence of conspiracy when some of the accused merely entertained a wish,\\nhowsoever, horrendous it may be, that offence be committed.\\n2.Acts subsequent to the achieving of object of conspiracy may tend to prove that\\na particular accused was party to the conspiracy. Once the object of conspiracy\\nhas been achieved, any subsequent act, which may be unlawful, would not make\\nthe accused a part of the conspiracy like giving shelter to an absconder.\\n3.Conspiracy is hatched in private or in secrecy. It is rarely possible to establish a\\nconspiracy by direct evidence. Usually, both the existence of the conspiracy and\\nits objects have to be inferred from the circumstances and the conduct of the\\naccused.\\n4.Conspirators may, for example, be enrolled in chain A enrolling B, B enrolling C,\\nand so on and all will be members of the single conspiracy if they so intend and\\nagree, even though each member knows only the person who enrolled him and\\nthe person whom he enrols. There may be a kind of umbrella-spoke enrolment,\\nwhere a single person at the centre doing the enrolling and all the other members\\nbeing unknown to each other, though they know that there are to be other\\nmembers. These are theories and in practice it may be diﬃcult to tell whether the\\nconspiracy in a particular case falls into which category. It may, however, even\\noverlap. But then there has to be present mutual interest. Persons may be\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 473}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='members of single conspiracy even though each is ignorant of the identity of\\nmany others who may have diverse role to play. It is not a part of the crime of\\nconspiracy that all the conspirators need to agree to play the same or an active\\nrole.\\n5.When two or more persons agree to commit a crime of conspiracy, then\\nregardless of making or considering any plans for its commission, and despite\\nthe fact that no step is taken by any such person to carry out their common\\npurpose, a crime is committed by each and every one who joins in the\\nagreement. There has thus, to be two conspirators and there may be more than\\nthat. To prove the charge of conspiracy it is not necessary that intended crime\\nwas committed or not. If committed it may further help prosecution to prove the\\ncharge of conspiracy.\\n6.It is not necessary that all conspirators should agree to the common purpose at\\nthe same time. They may join with other conspirators at any time before the\\nconsummation of the intended objective, and all are equally responsible. What\\npart each conspirator is to play may not be known to everyone or the fact as to\\nwhen a conspirator joined the conspiracy and when he left.\\n7.A charge of conspiracy may prejudice the accused because it is forced them into\\na joint trial and the Court may consider the entire mass of evidence against every\\naccused. Prosecution has to produce evidence not only to show that each of the\\naccused has knowledge of object of conspiracy but also of the agreement. In the\\ncharge of conspiracy Court has to guard itself against the danger of unfairness to\\nthe accused. Introduction of evidence against some may result in the conviction\\nof all, which is to be avoided. By means of evidence in conspiracy, which is\\notherwise inadmissible in the trial of any other substantive offence prosecution\\ntries to implicate the accused not only in the conspiracy itself but also in the\\nsubstantive crime of the alleged conspirators. There is always diﬃcult in tracing\\nthe precise contribution of each member of the conspiracy but then there has to\\nbe cogent and convincing evidence against each one of the accused charged\\nwith the offence of conspiracy. As observed to Judge Learned Hand that \"this\\ndistinction is important today when many prosecutors seek to sweep within the\\ndragnet of conspiracy all those who have been associated in any degree\\nwhatever with the main offenders\".\\n8.As stated above it is the unlawful agreement and not its accomplishment, which\\nis the gist or essence of the crime of conspiracy. Offence of criminal conspiracy\\nis complete even though there is no agreement as to the means by which the\\npurpose is to be accomplished. It is the unlawful agreement, which is the\\ngravamen of the crime of conspiracy. The unlawful agreement which amounts to\\na conspiracy need not be formal or express, but may be inherent in and inferred\\nfrom the circumstances, especially declarations, acts and conduct of the\\nconspirators. The agreement need not be entered into by all the parties to it at\\nthe same time, but may be reached by successive actions evidencing their joining\\nof the conspiracy.\\n9.It has been said that a criminal conspiracy is a partnership in crime, and that\\nthere is in each conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the prosecution of a\\ncommon plan. Thus, if two or more persons enter into a conspiracy, any act done\\nby any of them pursuant to the agreement is, in contemplation of law, the act of\\neach of them and they are jointly responsible therefor. This means that\\neverything said, written or done by any of the conspirators in execution or\\nfurtherance of the common purpose is deemed to have been said, done, or\\nwritten by each of them. And this joint responsibility extends not only to what is\\ndone by any of the conspirators pursuant to the original agreement but also to\\ncollateral acts incident to and growing out of the original purpose. A conspirator\\nis not responsible, however, for acts done by a co-conspirator after termination of', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 474}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\\nCHAPTER VI OF OFFENCES AGAINST THE STATE\\nThe offences against the State fall into the following groups:—\\nI. Waging, or attempting or conspiring to wage, or collecting men and ammunition to\\nwage war against the Government of India (sections 121, 121A, 122, 123).\\nII. Assaulting President, or Governor of a State with intent to compel or restrain the\\nexercise of any lawful power (section 124).\\nIII. Sedition (section 124A).\\nIV. War against a power at peace with the Government of India (section 125) or\\ncommitting depredations on the territories of such power (sections 125–126).\\nV. Permitting or aiding or negligently suffering the escape of, or rescuing or harbouring,\\na State prisoner (sections 128, 129, 130).\\n[s 121] Waging, or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war, against\\nthe Government of India.\\nWhoever, wages war1. against the 1[Government of India]2., or attempts, to wage such\\nwar, or abets the waging of such war3., shall be punished with death, or\\n2[imprisonment for life] 3[and shall also be liable to ﬁne].\\n4.[ILLUSTRATIONS]\\n5.[***] (a)A joins an insurrection against the 6.[Government of India]. A has\\ncommitted the offence deﬁned in this section.\\n7.[***]COMMENT—\\nEarlier the word used in section 121 was \"Queen\". After the formation of the republic\\nunder the Constitution it was substituted by the expression \"Government of India\" by\\nthe Adaption of Laws Order of 1950. In a republic, sovereignty vests in the people of the\\ncountry and the lawfully elected government is simply the representative and a\\nmanifestation of the sovereign, that is, the people. Thus, the expression \"Government of\\nIndia\", as appearing in section 121, must be held to mean the State or interchangeably\\nthe people of the country as the repository of the sovereignty of India which is\\nmanifested and expressed through the elected Government.8.\\n[s 121.1] Waging war against Government.—\\nThe concept of war embedded in section 121 is not to be understood in the\\ninternational law sense of inter-country war involving military operations by and\\nbetween two or more hostile countries. Section 121 is not meant to punish prisoners of\\nwar of a belligerent nation. Apart from the legislative history of the provision and the\\nunderstanding of the expression by various High Courts during the pre-independence', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 478}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='days, the Illustration to section 121 itself makes it clear that \"war\" contemplated by\\nsection 121 is not conventional warfare between two nations. Organising or joining an\\ninsurrection against the Government of India is also a form of war.9.\\nNeither the number of persons nor the manner in which they are assembled or armed is\\nmaterial to constitute an offence under this section. The true criterion is the purpose or\\nintention with which the gathering is assembled. The object of the gathering must be to\\nattain by force and violence an object of a general public nature thereby striking directly\\nagainst the Government\\'s authority.10.\\nIn Md Jamiluddin Nasir v State of WB,11. while enumerating what principles are to be\\nkept in mind in cases, involving application of sections 121, 122, 121A read with\\nsection 120B IPC, 1860 as well as section 302 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court, observed\\ninter alia that not all violent behaviour would fall within the prescription of waging war\\nas contemplated under sections 121, 121A, 122 read with section 120B. It was also\\nfound that the object sought to be achieved to make a case for the application of\\nsection 121, should be directed against the sovereignty of the State and not merely\\ncommission of a crime, even if that happens to be of higher magnitude. The concept of\\n\\'waging war\\' should not be stretched too far. A balanced and realistic approach should\\nbe maintained while construing the offence committed, to ﬁnd out whether it amounts\\nto waging of war against the State.\\n1. \\'Wages war\\'.—The expression \"waging war\" means and can only mean waging war in\\nthe manner usual in war. In other words, in order to support a conviction on such a\\ncharge it is not enough to show that the persons charged have contrived to obtain\\npossession of an armoury and have, when called upon to surrender it, used the riﬂes\\nand ammunition so obtained against the Government troops. It must also be shown\\nthat the seizure of the armoury was part and parcel of a planned operation and that\\ntheir intention in resisting the troops of the Government was to overwhelm and defeat\\nthese troops and then to go on and crush any further opposition with which they might\\nmeet until either the leaders of the movement succeeded in obtaining the possession\\nof the machinery of Government or those in possession of it yielded to the demands of\\ntheir leaders.12. An illuminating discussion on the issue of \"Waging war against the\\nGovernment of India\" is to be found in this Court\\'s decision in State (NCT of Delhi) v\\nNavjot Sandhu @ Afsan Guru.13. In para 272 of the judgment P Venkatarama Reddi, J,\\nspeaking for the Court, referred to the report of the Indian Law Commission that\\nexamined the draft Penal Code in 1847 and quoted the following passage from the\\nreport:\\nWe conceive the term \\'wages war against the Government\\' naturally to import a person\\narraying himself in deﬁance of the Government in like manner and by like means as a\\nforeign enemy would do, and it seems to us, we presume it did to the authors of the Code\\nthat any deﬁnition of the term so unambiguous would be superﬂuous.\\nThe expression, \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy\", is very\\nsigniﬁcant to understand the nature of the violent acts that would amount to waging\\nwar. In \"waging war\", the intent of the foreign enemy is not only to disturb public peace\\nor law and order or to kill many people. A foreign enemy strikes at the sovereignty of\\nthe State, and his conspiracy and actions are motivated by that animus.14.\\n[s 121.2] New concept of \"Waging war\" and Caution against using old\\nauthorities.—\\nThe concept of war in section 121 which includes insurrection or a civilian uprising\\nshould not be understood in the sense of conventional war between two nations or\\nsovereign entities. The normative phenomenon of war as understood in the', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 479}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='international sense does not ﬁt into the ambit and reach of section 121. In the\\nParliament attack case,15. the Supreme Court held as follows:\\nwhile these are the acceptable criteria of waging war, we must dissociate ourselves from\\nthe old English and Indian authorities to the extent that they lay down a too general test of\\nattainment of an object of general public nature or a political object. The Supreme Court\\nexpressed reservations in adopting this test in its literal sense and construing it in a manner\\nout of tune with the present day. The court must be cautious in adopting an approach which\\nhas the effect of bringing within the fold of S.121 all acts of lawless and violent acts\\nresulting in destruction of public properties, etc., and all acts of violent resistance to the\\narmed personnel to achieve certain political objectives. The moment it is found that the\\nobject sought to be attained is of a general public nature or has a political hue, the offensive\\nviolent acts targeted against the armed forces and public oﬃcials should not be branded as\\nacts of waging war. The expression \"waging war\" should not be stretched too far to hold\\nthat all the acts of disrupting public order and peace irrespective of their magnitude and\\nrepercussions could be reckoned as acts of waging war against the Government. A\\nbalanced and realistic approach is called for in construing the expression \"waging war\"\\nirrespective of how it was viewed in the long past. An organised movement attended with\\nviolence and attacks against the public oﬃcials and armed forces while agitating for the\\nrepeal of an unpopular law or for preventing burdensome taxes were viewed as acts of\\ntreason in the form of levying war. We doubt whether such construction is in tune with the\\nmodern day perspectives and standards.\\n[s 121.3] Terrorist Acts.—\\nThough every terrorist act does not amount to waging war, certain terrorist acts can\\nalso constitute the offence of waging war and there is no dichotomy between the two.\\nTerrorist acts can manifest themselves into acts of war. According to the learned\\nSenior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts prompted by an intention to strike at the\\nsovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount to waging war irrespective of\\nthe number involved or the force employed. However, the degree of animus or intent\\nand the magnitude of the acts done or attempted to be done would assume some\\nrelevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to a state of war. Yet,\\nthe demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a\\ndifference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist\\nacts with the acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force.\\nConspiracy to commit the latter offence is covered by section 121A.16. The\\nincorporation of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, shall not\\nbe viewed as deemed repeal of section 121 of the IPC, 1860. As explained in Navjot\\nSandhu (supra), a \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war against the Government of\\nIndia\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act\\nof waging war against the Government of India, and vice-versa. The provisions of\\nChapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and those of Chapter VI of the\\nIndian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 including section 121, basically cover different areas.17.\\n[s 121.4] Foreign nationals not excluded.—\\nThe word \"whoever\" is a word of broad import. Advisedly such language was used\\ndeparting from the observations made in the context of the Treason Statute. Supreme\\nCourt ﬁnds no good reason why foreign nationals stealthily entering into Indian territory\\nwith a view to subverting the functioning of the Government and destabilising the\\nsociety should not be held guilty of waging war within the meaning of section 121. The\\nsection on its plain term need not be conﬁned only to those who owe allegiance to the\\nestablished Government.18.\\nThe explanation to the section makes it clear that the offence is complete even without\\nany act or illegal omission occurring in pursuance of the conspiracy.19. It is not', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 480}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='necessary that any act or illegal omission should have taken place in pursuance of a\\nconspiracy. An action of waging war, attempt to wage war or abetment to wage war are\\nalso covered by section 121-A.20.\\n2. Government of India.—The expression \"Government of India\" is surely not used in the\\nnarrow and restricted sense in section 121. In our considered view, the expression\\n\"Government of India\" is used in section 121 to imply the Indian State, the juristic\\nembodiment of the sovereignty of the country that derives its legitimacy from the\\ncollective will and consent of its people. The use of the phrase \"Government of India\" to\\nsignify the notion of sovereignty is consistent with the principles of Public International\\nLaw, wherein sovereignty of a territorial unit is deemed to vest in the people of the\\nterritory and exercised by a representative government.21.\\n3. \\'Abets the waging of such war\\'.—Such abetment is made a special offence. It is not\\nessential that as a result of the abetment the war should in fact be waged. The main\\npurpose of the instigation should be \\'the waging of war\\'. It should not be merely a\\nremote and incidental purpose but the thing principally aimed at by the instigation.\\nThere must be active suggestion or stimulation to the use of violence.22. As criminal\\nacts took place pursuant to the conspiracy, the appellant, as a party to the conspiracy,\\nshall be deemed to have abetted the offence. In fact, he took an active part in a series\\nof steps taken to pursue the objective of conspiracy. The offence of abetting the\\nwaging of war, having regard to the extraordinary facts and circumstances of this case,\\njustiﬁes the imposition of capital punishment and, therefore, the judgment of the High\\nCourt in regard to the conviction and sentence of Afzal under section 121 IPC, 1860\\nshall stand.23.\\n[s 121.5] Principles relating to Section 121.—\\n(i)No speciﬁc number of persons is necessary to constitute an offence under\\nS.121, Penal Code.\\n(ii)The number concerned and the manner in which they are equipped or armed is\\nnot material.\\n(iii)The true criterion is quo animo did the gathering assemble?\\n(iv)The object of the gathering must be to attain by force and violence an object of\\na general public nature, thereby striking directly against the King\\'s authority.\\n(v)There is no distinction between principal and accessory and all who take part in\\nthe unlawful act incur the same guilt.24.\\n[s 121.6] CASES.—Mumbai Terror Attack Case.—\\nThe primary and the ﬁrst offence that the appellant and his co-conspirators committed\\nwas the offence of waging war against the Government of India. What matters is that\\nthe attack was aimed at India and Indians. It was by foreign nationals. People were\\nkilled for no other reason than they were Indians; in case of foreigners, they were killed\\nbecause their killing on Indian soil would embarrass India. The conspiracy, in\\nfurtherance of which the attack was made, was, inter alia, to hit at India; to hit at its\\nﬁnancial centre; to try to give rise to communal tensions and create internal strife and\\ninsurgency; to demand that India should withdraw from Kashmir; and to dictate its\\nrelations with other countries. Nothing could have been more \"in like manner and by', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 481}),\n",

The appellant was rightly held guilty of\\nwaging war against the Government of India and rightly convicted under sections 121,\\n121A and 122 of the IPC, 1860.25.\\n[s 121.7] Red Fort Attack Case.—\\nThe evidence as to the transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design would be\\nsuﬃcient for establishing the conspiracy. Again there must have been some act in\\npursuance of the agreement. The offence under section 121 of conspiring to wage a\\nwar is proved to the hilt against the appellant, for which he has been rightly held guilty\\nfor the offence punishable under sections 121 and 121-A, IPC, 1860.26.\\n[s 121.8] Parliament Attack Case.—\\nThe single most important factor which impels to think that this is a case of waging or\\nattempting to wage war against the Government of India is the target of attack chosen\\nby the slain terrorists and conspirators and the immediate objective sought to be\\nachieved thereby. The battlefront selected was the Parliament House complex. The\\ntarget chosen was Parliament – a symbol of the sovereignty of the Indian republic.\\nHuge and powerful explosives, sophisticated arms and ammunition carried by the slain\\nterrorists who were to indulge in ﬁdayeen operations with a deﬁnite purpose in view, is a\\nclear indicator of the grave danger in store for the inmates of the House. The planned\\noperations if executed, would have spelt disaster for the whole nation. The undoubted\\nobjective and determination of the deceased terrorists was to impinge on the sovereign\\nauthority of the nation and its Government. Even if the conspired purpose and objective\\nfalls short of installing some other authority or entity in the place of an established\\nGovernment, it does not detract from the offence of waging war.27.\\n[s 121.9] Charge under Section 121, conviction under Section 123.—\\nIn the case the Court has speciﬁcally dealt with the question whether the offence under\\nsection 123, IPC, 1860 of which the accused was not charged, is a minor offence falling\\nunder the charges framed, and held that the fact that there was no charge against the\\naccused under this particular section, does not, in any way, result in prejudice to him\\nbecause the charge of waging war and other allied offences are the subject matter of\\ncharges. It was held that the accused is not in any way handicapped by the absence of\\ncharge under section 123, IPC, 1860. The case which he had to meet under section 123\\nis no different from the case relating to the major charges which he was confronted\\nwith. In the face of the stand he had taken and his conduct even after the attack, he\\ncould not have pleaded reasonable excuse for not passing on the information. It was\\nheld that viewed from any angle, the evidence on record justiﬁes his conviction under\\nsection 123, IPC, 1860.28.\\n[s 121.10] Previous Sanction.—\\nNo Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI of IPC,\\n1860 except with the previous sanction of Central Government or of the State\\nGovernment.29.

It was thought right to make the offence of\\nconspiring by criminal force, or by show of criminal force, more severely penal than the\\noffence of actually taking part in an unlawful assembly, having for its object the\\noverawing of the Government. The reason was this that persons who by conspiring to\\nbring about such a result, set the whole matter in motion, seemed more criminal and\\nfar more deserving of punishment than those who were their mere tools, and only took\\npart in such an assembly.\\nThe Explanation to section 121A clariﬁes that it is not necessary that any act or illegal\\nomission should take place pursuant to the conspiracy, in order to constitute the said\\noffence. Thus, the criminal act done by the deceased terrorists in order to capture the\\nParliament House is an act that amounts to waging or attempting to wage war.

It was thought right to make the offence of\\nconspiring by criminal force, or by show of criminal force, more severely penal than the\\noffence of actually taking part in an unlawful assembly, having for its object the\\noverawing of the Government. The reason was this that persons who by conspiring to\\nbring about such a result, set the whole matter in motion, seemed more criminal and\\nfar more deserving of punishment than those who were their mere tools, and only took\\npart in such an assembly.\\nThe Explanation to section 121A clariﬁes that it is not necessary that any act or illegal\\nomission should take place pursuant to the conspiracy, in order to constitute the said\\noffence. Thus, the criminal act done by the deceased terrorists in order to capture the\\nParliament House is an act that amounts to waging or attempting to wage war.

       " Document(page_content='under Chapter VI of the IPC, 1860 has to be examined within the letter and spirit of the\\nConstitution and not as previously done under the imperial rule.67.\\nSedition in itself is a comprehensive term, and it embraces all those practices, whether\\nby word, deed, or writing, which are calculated to disturb the tranquillity of the State,\\nand lead ignorant persons to endeavour to subvert the Government and laws of the\\ncountry. The objects of sedition generally are to induce discontent and insurrection,\\nand stir up opposition to the Government, and bring the administration of justice into\\ncontempt; and the very tendency of sedition is to incite the people to insurrection and\\nrebellion.\\nSedition has been described as disloyalty in action, and the law considers as sedition all\\nthose practices which have for their object to excite discontent or dissatisfaction, to create\\npublic disturbance, or to lead to civil war; to bring into hatred or contempt the Sovereign or\\nthe Government, the laws or constitutions of the realm, and generally all endeavours to\\npromote public disorder.68.\\n[s 124A.1] Constitutional Validity.—\\nThe Supreme Court, in Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar,69. held that this section is not\\nunconstitutional and opined that only when it is construed that the words, written or\\nspoken, etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder\\nor disturbance of law and order the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest\\nof public order, then only the section strikes the correct balance between individual\\nfundamental rights and the interest of public order. The Court also held that a citizen\\nhas a right to say or write whatever he likes about the Government, or its measures, by\\nway of criticism or comment, so long as he does not incite people to violence against\\nthe Government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder.\\nThe Supreme Court in a later Order in Common Cause v UOI70. ordered that the\\nauthorities while dealing with the offences under section 124A of the IPC, 1860 shall be\\nguided by the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench in Kedar Nath Singh.\\nSection 124A]\\n[s 124A.2] Ingredients.—\\nThis section requires two essentials:—\\n1. Bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt, or exciting or attempting to\\nexcite disaffection towards the Government of India.\\n2. Such act or attempt may be done (i) by words, either spoken or written; or (ii) by\\nsigns; or (iii) by visible representation.\\n1. Bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt, or exciting or attempting to\\nexcite disaffection towards the Government of India.—A plain reading of the section\\nwould show that its application would be attracted only when the accused brings or\\nattempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection\\ntowards the Government established by law in India, by words either written or spoken\\nor visible signs or representations, etc.71. Necessary ingredient to attract punishment\\nunder section 124A, IPC, 1860, appears to be the effort of bringing or attempting to\\nbring into hatred or contempt to excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the\\nGovernment established by law in India by words, either spoken or written or by signs\\nor by visible representation or otherwise.72. The offence does not consist in exciting or\\nattempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any sort of actual disturbance, great or', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 498}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='small. Whether any disturbance or outbreak was caused by the publication of seditious\\narticles is absolutely immaterial. If the accused intended by the articles to excite\\nrebellion or disturbance, his act would doubtless fall within this section, and would\\nprobably fall within other sections of the IPC, 1860. If he tried to excite feelings of\\nhatred or contempt towards the Government, that is suﬃcient to make him guilty under\\nthis section.73. The Federal Court of India had, however, held that the gist of the\\noffence of sedition is incitement to violence; mere abusive words are not enough.74.\\nThe view of the Federal Court was subsequently overruled by the Privy Council,75. as\\nbeing opposed to the view expressed in several cases.76.\\nIn appreciating whether the act done by the accused by words \"either spoken or written\\nor by signs or by misrepresentation or otherwise\" one cannot shut one\\'s eyes to\\nchanges in political consumptions which have taken place over the course of time after\\nthe aforesaid penal provision section 124A was included in the IPC, 1860 and the\\ndeclared objective of the Government of the day. Very often, the demarcating line\\nbetween political criticism of the Government and those causing disaffection against\\nthe Government is thin and waving.77.\\nIt is not an essential ingredient of sedition that the act done should be an act which is\\nintended or likely to incite to public disorder.78.

       " Document(page_content='under Chapter VI of the IPC, 1860 has to be examined within the letter and spirit of the\\nConstitution and not as previously done under the imperial rule.67.\\nSedition in itself is a comprehensive term, and it embraces all those practices, whether\\nby word, deed, or writing, which are calculated to disturb the tranquillity of the State,\\nand lead ignorant persons to endeavour to subvert the Government and laws of the\\ncountry. The objects of sedition generally are to induce discontent and insurrection,\\nand stir up opposition to the Government, and bring the administration of justice into\\ncontempt; and the very tendency of sedition is to incite the people to insurrection and\\nrebellion.\\nSedition has been described as disloyalty in action, and the law considers as sedition all\\nthose practices which have for their object to excite discontent or dissatisfaction, to create\\npublic disturbance, or to lead to civil war; to bring into hatred or contempt the Sovereign or\\nthe Government, the laws or constitutions of the realm, and generally all endeavours to\\npromote public disorder.68.\\n[s 124A.1] Constitutional Validity.—\\nThe Supreme Court, in Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar,69. held that this section is not\\nunconstitutional and opined that only when it is construed that the words, written or\\nspoken, etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder\\nor disturbance of law and order the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest\\nof public order, then only the section strikes the correct balance between individual\\nfundamental rights and the interest of public order. The Court also held that a citizen\\nhas a right to say or write whatever he likes about the Government, or its measures, by\\nway of criticism or comment, so long as he does not incite people to violence against\\nthe Government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder.\\nThe Supreme Court in a later Order in Common Cause v UOI70. ordered that the\\nauthorities while dealing with the offences under section 124A of the IPC, 1860 shall be\\nguided by the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench in Kedar Nath Singh.\\nSection 124A]\\n[s 124A.2] Ingredients.—\\nThis section requires two essentials:—\\n1. Bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt, or exciting or attempting to\\nexcite disaffection towards the Government of India.\\n2. Such act or attempt may be done (i) by words, either spoken or written; or (ii) by\\nsigns; or (iii) by visible representation.\\n1. Bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt, or exciting or attempting to\\nexcite disaffection towards the Government of India.—A plain reading of the section\\nwould show that its application would be attracted only when the accused brings or\\nattempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection\\ntowards the Government established by law in India, by words either written or spoken\\nor visible signs or representations, etc.71. Necessary ingredient to attract punishment\\nunder section 124A, IPC, 1860, appears to be the effort of bringing or attempting to\\nbring into hatred or contempt to excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the\\nGovernment established by law in India by words, either spoken or written or by signs\\nor by visible representation or otherwise.72. The offence does not consist in exciting or\\nattempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any sort of actual disturbance, great or\\nsmall. Whether any disturbance or outbreak was caused by the publication of seditious\\narticles is absolutely immaterial.

       " Document(page_content='probably fall within other sections of the IPC, 1860. If he tried to excite feelings of\\nhatred or contempt towards the Government, that is suﬃcient to make him guilty under\\nthis section.73. The Federal Court of India had, however, held that the gist of the\\noffence of sedition is incitement to violence; mere abusive words are not enough.74.\\nThe view of the Federal Court was subsequently overruled by the Privy Council,75. as\\nbeing opposed to the view expressed in several cases.76.\\nIn appreciating whether the act done by the accused by words \"either spoken or written\\nor by signs or by misrepresentation or otherwise\" one cannot shut one\\'s eyes to\\nchanges in political consumptions which have taken place over the course of time after\\nthe aforesaid penal provision section 124A was included in the IPC, 1860 and the\\ndeclared objective of the Government of the day. Very often, the demarcating line\\nbetween political criticism of the Government and those causing disaffection against\\nthe Government is thin and waving.77.\\nIt is not an essential ingredient of sedition that the act done should be an act which is\\nintended or likely to incite to public disorder.78. But this view of the law does no longer\\nseem to be correct, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Kedar Nath\\'s\\ncase,79. wherein Sinha, CJ observed:\\ncomments, however strongly worded expressing, disapprobation of actions of Government,\\nwithout exciting those feelings which generate the inclination to cause public disorder by\\nacts of violence, would not be penal.

Where the propaganda secretary of a Gurdwara addressed a\\ngathering of Sikhs, some of whom were wearing black clothes and turbans, and in\\ncourse of his speech though he did not give direct incitement to violence but he\\nnevertheless gave exaggerated ﬁgures of casualties following Army action in Punjab, it\\nwas held that it would be quite proper to infer from the text and tenor of the speech\\nmade by the accused that the same was intended to bring the Government into\\ncontempt with the likelihood of eruption of violence and public disorder contemplated\\nin Kedarnath\\'s case.

       " Document(page_content=\"constituents or dimensions of an offence under section 149 simpliciter with regard to\\ndictionary meaning of the words 'unlawful assembly' or 'assembly'.2. An assembly of\\nﬁve or more persons having as its common object any of the ﬁve objects enumerated\\nunder section 1 41 of IPC is deemed to be an unlawful assembly. Membership of an\\nunlawful assembly is itself an offence punishable under section.143, whereas other\\nspecies of the said offence are dealt with under section 143–145 of IPC. Similarly,\\nsections 146–148 of IPC deals with the offence of rioting which is deﬁned to be use of\\nforce or violence by any member thereof. Section 149 makes every member of an\\nunlawful assembly liable for offence that may be committed by any member of the\\nunlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for\\ncommission of any offence that the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object of the assembly.3. To bring a case\\nwithin section 149 of IPC some essential features must be present. First, there must be\\nan existence of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141 of IPC. This is\\na mixed question of fact and law.4.\\nThe underlying principle of section 141 is that law discourages tumultuous assemblage\\nof men to preserve the public peace. Section 141 deﬁnes what an 'unlawful assembly'\\nis. Section 142 gives the connotations of 'a member of an unlawful assembly'. Section\\n143 punishes tumultuous assemblies as they endanger public peace. It does not\\nrequire that the purpose of the unlawful assembly should have been fulﬁlled.\\nThe essence of an offence under this section is the combination of ﬁve or more\\npersons, united in the purpose of committing a criminal offence, and the consensus of\\npurpose is itself an offence distinct from the criminal offence which these persons\\nagree and intend to commit.5. Unlike the Indian law contained in section 141, IPC, 1860,\\nan unlawful assembly at common law need to have only three or more persons who\\nmust assemble together for the common purpose of committing an offence involving\\nuse of violence, or for achieving a lawful or unlawful object in such a manner so as to\\nlead to a reasonable apprehension of a breach of peace as a direct result of their\\nconduct.6. Thus, under section 141, IPC, especially under sub-section (3) thereof, use of\\nviolence or likelihood of breach of the peace is not at all a sine qua non for an offence\\nof unlawful assembly but this is so under the common law. So under the common law,\\neven if the purpose of the assembly is unlawful, the offence of being an unlawful\\nassembly would not be committed if there is no likelihood of breach of the peace and\\nthis would be so even if the unlawful common purpose is carried out.\\n[s 143.1] Ingredients.—\\nAn 'unlawful assembly' is an assembly of ﬁve or more persons if their common object\\nis—\\n1.to overawe by criminal force\\n(a)the Central Government, or\\n(b)the State Government, or\\n(c)the Legislature, or\\n(d)any public servant in the exercise of lawful power;\\n2.to resist the execution of law or legal process;\\n3.to commit mischief, criminal trespass, or any other offence;\\n4.by criminal force—\\n(a)to take or obtain possession of any property, or\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 536}),\n",

In other words, it is an\\nessential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be ﬁve or more.\\nThe Supreme Court has endorsed the view that the number of injuries caused and the\\nnumber of persons who were inﬂicted with those injuries, (in this case, three persons\\nwere attacked and they sustained 13, 12 and 7 injuries respectively) can give a clue to\\nthe fact that more than three persons must necessarily have participated in the\\nattack.8.\\n[s 143.2] Effect of acquittal of some accused:\\nIn Mohan Singh v State of Punjab,9. the Supreme Court considered the question of\\nacquittal of two of the accused charged for the offence under section 302 read with\\nsection 149, on the conviction of the remaining three accused. If ﬁve or more persons\\nare named in the charge as forming an unlawful assembly and the evidence adduced\\nby the prosecution proves that charge against all of them that is a very clear case\\nwhere section 149 could be invoked. \"It is however not necessary that ﬁve or more\\npersons must be convicted before a charge under section 149 could be successfully\\nbrought home to any members of the unlawful assembly. It may be that less than ﬁve\\npersons may be charged and convicted under section 302 read with section 149, if the\\ncharge is that persons before the court along with others named, constituted an\\nunlawful assembly. Other persons so named may not be available for trial along with\\ntheir companions for the reason that they have absconded. In such a case, the fact that\\nless than ﬁve persons are before the court does not make section 149 inapplicable.\\nTherefore, in order to bring home a charge under section 149, it is not necessary that\\nﬁve or more persons must necessarily be brought before the court and convicted …\" In\\nview of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh\\'s case,10. even after\\nacquittal of the two accused from all the charges levelled against them, if there is any\\nmaterial that they were members of the unlawful assembly, the conviction under\\nsection 302 can be based with the aid of section 149.11.\\nWhere two of the six accused persons were acquitted without any ﬁnding that some\\nother known or unknown persons also were involved in the assault, the remaining four\\naccused persons could not be said to be members of an unlawful assembly.12. Where\\na group of persons, differently armed, assaulted a man with the common object of\\nkilling him and all the assailants accused except one were acquitted, it was held that\\nthe remaining sole accused could not be convicted and sentenced under section 302\\nwith the aid of section 149. The court cannot carve out a new case.13. If out of an\\nunlawful assembly consisting of seven named persons four are acquitted, the other\\nthree cannot be convicted of rioting as members of an unlawful assembly.14. They may,\\nhowever, be convicted of the principal offence with the aid of section 34, IPC, 1860.15.\\nWhere presence of eight persons in the course of assault was established, four of them\\nwere given beneﬁt of doubt but there was no ﬁnding anywhere to the effect that only', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 537}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"four persons had taken part in the assault, conviction of the remaining four on the\\ncharge of forming unlawful assembly was not illegal.16.\\n2. 'Common object'.— The common object of an unlawful assembly depends ﬁrstly on\\nwhether such object can be classiﬁed as one of those described in section 141;\\nsecondly, such common object need not be the product of prior concert but may form\\non spur of the moment, ﬁnally, nature of such common object is a question of fact to\\nbe determined by considering the nature of arms, nature of assembly, behaviour of\\nmembers, etc.17. Mere presence in an assembly does not make a person a member of\\nan unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done something or omitted to do\\nsomething which would make him a member of the unlawful assembly or unless the\\ncase falls under section 142.18. Thus, merely because some persons assembled, all of\\nthem cannot be condemned 'ipso facto' as being members of that unlawful\\nassembly.19. At the same time it cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law\\nthat unless an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of\\nunlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only\\nthing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and\\nwas likely to commit any of the acts which fall within the purview of section 141.20.\\nFurther the prosecution has to prove that the commission of the offence was by any\\nmember of an unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed in\\nprosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such that the members\\nof the assembly knew that it was likely to be committed.21. The word 'object' means the\\npurpose or design and, in order to make it 'common', it must be shared by all. In other\\nwords, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that\\nis to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be\\nformed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by no means\\nnecessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly and\\nthe other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not continue to be\\nthe same. It may be modiﬁed or altered or abandoned at any stage.22.\\nSection 142 postulates that whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly\\nan unlawful one, intentionally joins the same would be a member thereof. Whether an\\nassembly is unlawful one or not, would depend on various factors, the principal\\namongst them being a common object formed by the members thereof to commit an\\noffence speciﬁed in one or the other clauses contained in section 141.23. In a free ﬁght\\nbetween two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to several others on\\nboth the sides, it was held that the formation of an unlawful assembly was not\\nimpossible but the common object of such an assembly cannot be determined on the\\nbasis of serious injury by one of them.24. The accused along with about six–eight\\nothers forcibly entered into the oﬃce of a union leader and assaulted him but the victim\\ndid not receive any serious injury inside the union oﬃce and managed to escape. Later\\non in the open space some members of the crowd surrounded and attacked him and\\ndealt fatal blows. It was held that the accused who entered the union oﬃce did not\\nshare the common object of committing murder of the deceased. They were convicted\\nunder sections 326/149.25. Where the accused forming an unlawful assembly\\nassaulted the deceased but the injury caused by only one accused proved to be fatal\\nand the injuries caused by the others were found to be simple, it was held that the\\ncommon object of the unlawful assembly was only to cause grievous hurt and only the\\naccused who caused fatal injury was liable to be convicted for murder and others\\nunder section 326/149.26.\\nThe Supreme Court observed on the facts of a case that given the circumstances in\\nwhich the assembly came together and given that all parties were aware that among\\nthem, certain members carried weapons like guns and spear, even if it was held that\\ncommon object of assembly was not to cause death, it would not be an unreasonable\\ninference that all accused knew that the offence of culpable homicide was likely to be\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 538}),\n",

Therefore, it was held, that any of the accused found to have participated\\nin the assault should be held guilty under section 141 and 149.27.\\n[s 143.3] Determination of Common object:\\nDetermination of the common object of an unlawful assembly or the determination of\\nthe question whether a member of the unlawful assembly knew that the offence that\\nwas committed was likely to be committed is essentially a question of fact that has to\\nbe made keeping in view the nature of the assembly, the arms carried by the members\\nand the behaviour of the members at or near the scene and a host of similar or\\nconnected facts and circumstances that cannot be entrapped by any attempt at an\\nexhaustive enumeration.28. It is diﬃcult indeed, though not impossible, to collect direct\\nevidence of such knowledge. An inference may be drawn from circumstances such as\\nthe background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the\\narms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour\\nof the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime.29.\\n[s 143.4] Second clause—Resisting Law or Legal Process.—\\nResistance to some law, or legal process, connotes some overt act, and mere words,\\nwhen there is no intention of carrying them into effect, are not suﬃcient to prove an\\nintention to resist.30. When an order is lawfully made under the provisions of a statute,\\nthat order is law, and resistance to the execution of that law is an offence.31.\\nUnder this clause the act resisted must be a legal act. Where a number of persons\\nresisted an attempt to search a house which was being made by oﬃcers, who had not\\nthe written order investing them with the power to do so, it was held that the persons\\nresisting the attempted search were not guilty of this offence.32. Assembling together\\nfor the common object of rescuing a friend from unlawful police detention has been\\nheld by the Supreme Court as not constituting an unlawful assembly.33.\\n[s 143.5] Third clause.—Committing Criminal Trespass, Mischief, other\\noffence.—\\nThis clause speciﬁes only two offences, viz., mischief and criminal trespass, but the\\nwords \\'or other offence\\' seem to denote that all offences are included though only two\\nare enumerated in a haphazard way. In Manga @ Man Singh v State of Uttarakhand, the\\nSupreme Court while considering the application of principle of \\'ejusdem generis\\' to\\nsection 141 \\'third\\' clause, observed that:\\nWe fail to appreciate as to how simply because the offences mischief or criminal trespass\\nare used preceding the expression \"other offence\" in Section 141 \\'third\\', it should be taken\\nthat such offence would only relate to a minor offence of mischief or trespass and that the\\nexpression \"other offence\" should be restricted only to that extent. As pointed out by us\\nabove, the offence of mischief and trespass could also be as grave as that of an offence of\\nmurder, for which the punishment of life imprisonment can be imposed as provided for\\nunder Sections 438, 449, 450 etc. Therefore, we straight away hold that the argument of\\nlearned senior counsel for the Appellants to import the principle of \\'ejusdem generis\\' to\\nSection 141 \\'third\\', cannot be accepted.34.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 539}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 143.6] Suleman Bakery Case:\\nIt is a case related to the communal riots of Mumbai in early 1993. Government\\nimposed curfew and the Special Operation Squad (SOS) was called to control the\\ncommunal riots on information of stone pelting, throwing of glass bottles, acid bulbs\\nand ﬁring from the terrace of Suleman Bakery. It was argued that at any rate SOS was\\nan unlawful assembly on account of the third clause of section 141 of IPC, 1860, and\\nhence, all the discharged accused persons were members of the unlawful assembly\\nand had to be at least charged and inquired into by the courts below. It was argued that\\nthe assembly of the police at least till the time they broke open the door was a lawful\\nmove, as it was their duty but they should not have broken open the door and\\ntrespassed the Suleman bakery; and all those who entered Suleman bakery formulated\\nan unlawful assembly as they illegally trespassed into the Suleman bakery. Since A-1,\\nShri Tyagi, had ordered them to break open the doors and he was a part of that unlawful\\nassembly who had the common object. The Supreme Court held that they were all the\\nmembers of the SOS and had the duty to quell the riots. They were not doing anything\\nillegal in coming out and trying to control the riots. Court rejected the argument by\\nholding that a trespass becomes a criminal trespass if it is with an intention to annoy\\nor to do something illegal which is not the case here. There was no question of the so-\\ncalled entry amounting to criminal trespass.35.\\n[s 143.7] Fourth clause—Application of Criminal Force.—\\nThe act falling within the purview of this clause is made punishable owing to the\\ninjurious consequences which it is likely to cause to the public peace. This clause does\\nnot take away the right of private defence of property. It does not affect clause 2 of\\nsection 105, which allows a person to recover the property carried away by theft. It is\\nmeant to prevent the resort to force in vindication of supposed rights. It makes a\\ndistinction between an admitted claim or an ascertained right and a disputed claim.36.\\nWhere ﬁve or more persons assemble for maintaining by force or show of force a right\\nwhich they bona ﬁde believe they possess, and not for enforcing by such force or show\\nof force a right or supposed right of theirs, they do not constitute an unlawful\\nassembly.37. An assembly of ﬁve or more persons cannot be designated as an unlawful\\nassembly under this section if its object is to defend property by the use of force within\\nthe limits prescribed by law.38. But when a body of men are determined to vindicate\\ntheir rights, or supposed rights, by unlawful force, and when they engage in a ﬁght with\\nmen who, on the other hand, are equally determined to vindicate, by unlawful force,\\ntheir rights or supposed rights, no question of self-defence arises. Neither side is trying\\nto protect itself, but each side is trying to get the better of the other.39.\\n[s 143.8] Fifth clause—Compelling persons to act or omission.—\\nThis clause is very comprehensive and applies to all the rights a man can possess,\\nwhether they concern the enjoyment of property or not. There is no reference to 'any\\nright or supposed right' as in the preceding clause.\\n[s 143.9] Explanation.—\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 540}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='An assembly which is lawful in its inception may become unlawful by the subsequent\\nact of its members.40. It may turn unlawful all of a sudden and without previous\\nconcert among its members.41. But illegal acts of one or two members, not acquiesced\\nin by the others, do not change the character of the assembly.42. The law on the point\\nas stated above is approved by the Supreme Court in Moti Das.43.\\n[s 143.10] Being member of unlawful assembly.—\\nSection 142 shows that it is suﬃcient for the offence of riot to be proved against an\\nindividual that the individual should remain in an unlawful assembly as soon as he is\\naware that the assembly is unlawful. The word \"continues\" in the section means\\nphysical presence as a member of the unlawful assembly, that is, to be physically\\npresent in the crowd.44. This, however, should not be interpreted to mean that mere\\npresence as a curious onlooker or bystander at the scene of the unlawful assembly\\nwithout sharing its common object would make a person liable under section 142, IPC,\\n1860, for being a member of an unlawful assembly.45. Thus common object cannot be\\nattributed to a person from his mere presence at the scene of the occurrence. There\\nmust be some other direct or circumstantial evidence to justify that inference.46.\\nFor being a member of unlawful assembly it is not necessary that a person must\\ncommit some overt act towards the commission of the crime. The test is whether he\\nknows of its common object and continues to keep its company due to his own free\\nwill.47. Thus, where a large procession of Kannadigas, taken out to voice protest\\nagainst Maharashtrians, turned violent, started pelting stones and attacking police\\noﬃcers; the procession turned into an unlawful assembly the moment it developed the\\ncommon object of causing damage to property and injuries to police oﬃcers.\\nThereafter, every person who continued as a member of the assembly became liable\\nfor the offence committed by the processionalists by virtue of section 149 of IPC,\\n1860.48. If some unidentiﬁed members of an unlawful assembly behaved in an unruly\\nmanner, the other members in the procession cannot be held guilty of the offence by\\nfoisting vicarious liability, merely because they were in the procession.49.\\n[s 143.11] CASES.—Enforcement of right by use of criminal force.—Dispute\\nregarding possession of land.—\\nWhere there was a dispute of long standing between the accused and certain other\\nparties regarding possession of certain land, and the accused went to sow the land\\nwith indigo, accompanied by a body of men armed with sticks who kept off the\\nopposite party by brandishing their weapons while the land was sowed, it was held that\\nthey were guilty of this offence.50. Where the accused, who were in possession of the\\ndisputed land, went upon it in a large body armed with sticks, prepared in anticipation\\nof a ﬁght, and were reaping the paddy grown by them, when the complainant\\'s party\\ncame up and attempted to cut the same, whereupon a ﬁght ensued and one man was\\nseriously wounded and died subsequently, it was held that the common object was not\\nto enforce a right but to maintain undisturbed the actual enjoyment of a right and that\\nthe assembly was not therefore unlawful.51.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 541}),\n",

It is only the use of force that\\ndistinguishes rioting from an unlawful assembly.54.

For a successful prosecution\\nof a riot case the prosecution must prove:—\\n(i)that there were ﬁve or more persons;\\n(ii)that they had a common purpose;\\n(iii)that they had begun to execute such purpose;\\n(iv)that they intended to help one another by force, if necessary;\\n(v)that they had shown such degree of violence which would alarm at least one\\nperson of reasonable courage.\\nThis last mentioned fact need not be proved by calling a person, who has been so\\nalarmed but it may be made out from facts and circumstances of the case in hand.55.\\nThe ingredients mentioned in item numbers (iv) and (v) above are not to be found at all\\nin section 146 of IPC, 1860. Where some youths exceeding three were found\\ndemolishing a wall but disappeared the moment the caretaker of the building appeared\\nat the scene, it was held that they could not be convicted of the offence of riot under\\nthe common law as there was no evidence of show of violence suﬃcient to alarm one\\nperson of reasonable ﬁrmness and courage.56. In the Indian context in this very case\\nthe offence of rioting was complete the moment the youths used force to demolish the\\nwall for it was not necessary in the Indian law to use force or violence against a person,\\nfar less to cause alarm to a person of reasonable courage and ﬁrmness. Force or\\nviolence against an inanimate object too comes within the purview of section 146, IPC,\\n1860.57.\\n[s 147.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe following are the essentials of the offence of rioting:—\\n(1)That the accused persons, being ﬁve or more in number, formed an unlawful\\nassembly.\\n(2)That they were animated by a common object.\\n(3)That force or violence was used by the unlawful assembly or any member of it in\\nprosecution of the common object.\\n1. 'Force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly'.—The word 'violence' is not\\nrestricted to force used against persons only, but extends also to force against\\ninanimate objects.58. The words 'force' and 'violence' in this section connote different\\nand distinct concepts. 'Force' is narrowed down by the deﬁnition under section 350 to\\npersons while the word 'violence' includes violence to property and other inanimate\\nobjects.59.\\nThe use of any force, even though it be of the slightest possible character, by any one\\nof an assembly once established as unlawful, constitutes rioting.60. Where a member\\nof an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of the assembly throws\\ndown a man and then causes him bodily hurt, the offence of rioting under this section\\nis complete as soon as the man is thrown down by using force and the hurt\\nsubsequently caused would come under section 323 or section 325.61. The essential\\nquestion in a case under section 147 is whether there was an unlawful assembly of ﬁve\\nor more persons. The identity of the persons comprising the assembly is a matter\\nrelating to the determination of the guilt of the individual accused and even when it is\\npossible to convict less than ﬁve persons only, section 147 still applies, if upon the\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 551}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"evidence in the case the Court is able to hold that the person or persons who have been\\nfound guilty were members of an assembly of ﬁve or more persons, known or unknown,\\nidentiﬁed or unidentiﬁed.62. It has been held by the Supreme Court that this section is\\nnot attracted where the act in question was done in pursuit of a lawful object. In this\\ncase the investigating police party was being led by the witness to a spot for recovering\\nthe dead-body. The witness tried to run away and was beaten up with a lathi. He died\\nshortly thereafter. The Supreme Court did not sustain the conviction of the police\\npersonnel under this section.63.\\n2. 'In prosecution of the common object'.—Acts done by some members of an unlawful\\nassembly outside the common object of the assembly or of such a nature as the\\nmembers of the assembly could not have known to be likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of that object are only chargeable against the actual perpetrators of those\\nacts.64. It is obligatory on the part of the court to examine that if the offence\\ncommitted is not in direct prosecution of the common object, it yet may fall under\\nsecond part of section 149, IPC, 1860, if the offence was such as the members knew\\nwas likely to be committed. Further inference has to be drawn as what was the number\\nof persons; how many of them were merely passive witnesses; what were their arms\\nand weapons. Number and nature of injuries is also relevant to be considered.65.\\n[s 147.2] 'Resistance to illegal warrant'.—\\nResistance to the execution of an illegal warrant within reasonable bounds does not\\namount to rioting; but when the right of resistance is exceeded and a severe injury, not\\ncalled for, is inﬂicted, the person who inﬂicts the injury may be convicted of such\\ninjury.66.\\n[s 147.3] 'Sudden quarrel'.—\\nIf a number of persons assembled for any lawful purpose suddenly quarrel without any\\nprevious intention or design, they do not commit 'riot' in the legal sense of the word.67.\\n[s 147.4] 'Fundamental principles in cases of mammoth rioting'.—\\n(1) Notwithstanding the large number of rioters or of the persons put up in Court for\\nrioting, and the consequent diﬃculty for the prosecution to name the speciﬁc acts\\nattributed to each of the accused, the Court must see to it that all the ingredients\\nrequired for unlawful assembly and rioting are strictly proved by the prosecution before\\nconvicting the particular accused persons.68.(2) Spectators, wayfarers, etc., attracted\\nto the scene of the rioting by curiosity, should not be, by reason of their mere presence\\nat the scene of rioting and with the rioters, held to be members of the unlawful\\nassembly or rioters. But of course, if they are proved to have marched with the rioters\\nfor a long distance, when the rioters were shouting tell-tale slogans and pelting stones,\\nit will be for them to prove their innocence under section 106 of the Indian Evidence\\nAct, 1872. (3) It will be very unsafe, in the case of such a large mob of rioters, to rely on\\nthe evidence of a single witness speaking to the presence of an accused in that mob for\\nconvicting him, especially when no overt act of violence, or shouting of slogan, or\\norganising the mob, or giving orders to it or marching in procession with it, or other\\nsimilar thing is proved against him. In a big riot by hundreds of persons, it is very easy\\neven to mistake one person for another, and to implicate honestly really innocent\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 552}),\n",

An\\nordinary rule of caution and prudence will require that an accused person identiﬁed\\nonly by one witness, and not proved to have done any overt act, etc., as described\\nabove, should be acquitted, by giving him the beneﬁt of the doubt. (4) Where there are\\nacute factions based on either agrarian disputes and troubles or on political wrangling\\nand rivalry or on caste divisions or on divisions of the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" the\\ngreatest care must be exercised before believing the evidence of a particular witness\\nbelonging to one of these factions against an accused of the opposite view. This\\nprinciple becomes of special importance when there are no overt acts, etc., proved, and\\nwhen there are only one or two witnesses speaking to the presence of the accused\\namong the rioters, and they belong to the classes or factions opposed to the accused.\\n(5) Mere followers in rioting deserve a much more lenient sentence than leaders, who\\nmislead them into such violent acts, by emotional appeals, slogans and cries.69.\\n[s 147.5] Offence Compoundable:\\nWhen an offence is compoundable under section 320 of Cr PC, 1973, and where the\\naccused is liable under section 34 or 149 of IPC (45 of 1860) it may be compounded in\\nlike manner.70.\\n[s 147.6] CASES.—\\nWhere several Hindus, acting in concert, forcibly removed an ox and two cows from the\\npossession of a Mohammedan, not for the purpose of causing \\'wrongful gain\\' to\\nthemselves or \\'wrongful loss\\' to the owner of the cattle, but for the purpose of\\npreventing the killing of the cows, it was held that they were guilty of rioting.71. There\\nwas a dispute about the possession of a certain land between the complainant and the\\naccused. The complainant dug a well with a view to cultivate the said land. The\\naccused forcibly entered on the land and damaged the well. It was held that the\\naccused were guilty under this section as an accused person is not entitled to go upon\\nhis own land and by violence destroy the property of the complainant, even though a\\ntrespasser.72.\\n[s 147.7] No unlawful assembly.—\\nThe accused on receiving information that the complainant\\'s party were about to take\\nforcible possession of a plot of their land, collected a number of men, some of whom\\nwere armed, and went to the land. While they were engaged in ploughing, the\\ncomplainant\\'s party came up and interfered with the ploughing. A ﬁght ensued, in the\\ncourse of which one of the complainant\\'s party was grievously wounded and\\nsubsequently died, and two of the accused\\'s party were hurt. It was held that the\\naccused were justiﬁed in taking such precautions as they thought were required to\\nprevent the aggression, and that they were not members of an unlawful assembly.73.\\n[s 147.8] Free ﬁght.—\\nIn a free ﬁght there cannot be said to be any formation of an unlawful assembly and\\ncommon intention. Each accused will be responsible for his individual act.74.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 553}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='an unlawful assembly for acts done in prosecution of the common object of that\\nassembly or for such offences as the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be\\nlikely to be committed in prosecution of that object.82. However, Benches of a smaller\\nstrength in some cases83. have observed that section 149 creates a speciﬁc and\\ndistinct offence. Thus the law declared therein by the Benches of a smaller strength\\ncannot be taken as correct legal position.84. This section creates a speciﬁc and distinct\\noffence.85. It is not the intention of the legislature in enacting section 149 to render\\nevery member of unlawful assembly liable to punishment for every offence committed\\nby one or more of its members. In order to attract section 149, it must be shown that\\nthe incriminating act was done to accomplish the common object of unlawful\\nassembly and it must be within the knowledge of other members as one likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object.86. A plain reading of the section\\nshows that the provision is in two parts. The ﬁrst part deals with cases in which an\\noffence is committed by any member of the assembly \"in prosecution of the common\\nobject\" of that assembly. The second part deals with cases where the commission of a\\ngiven offence is not by itself the common object of the unlawful assembly but\\nmembers of such assembly \\'knew that the same is likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of the common object of the assembly\\'.87. This section makes both the\\ncategories of persons, those who have committed the offence as also those who were\\nmembers of the same assembly liable for the offences under section 149, IPC, 1860,\\nprovided the other requirements of the section are satisﬁed. That is to say, if an offence\\nis committed by any person of an unlawful assembly, which the members of that\\nassembly knew to be likely to be committed, every member of such an assembly is\\nguilty of the offence. The law is clear that membership of unlawful assembly is\\nsuﬃcient to hold such participating members vicariously liable. For mulcting liability on\\nthe members of an unlawful assembly under section 149, it is not necessary that every\\nmember of the unlawful assembly should commit the offence in prosecution of the\\ncommon object of the assembly. Mere knowledge of the likelihood of commission of\\nsuch an offence by the members of the assembly is suﬃcient.88. Whenever the court\\nconvicts any person or persons of any offence with the aid of section 149, a clear\\nﬁnding regarding the common object of the assembly must be given and the evidence\\ndisclosed must show not only the nature of the common object but also that the object\\nwas unlawful. If members of the assembly knew or were aware of the likelihood of a\\nparticular offence being committed in prosecution of a common object, they would be\\nliable for the same under section 149.89. In the absence of such ﬁnding as also any\\novert act on the part of the accused persons, mere fact that they were armed would not\\nbe suﬃcient to prove common object.90. Where the moot question as to common\\nobjective is proved all the members of unlawful assembly would be vicariously liable\\nfor the acts done by the said assembly and thus the separate roles played by all the\\naccused persons need not be examined.91. Section 149 makes it abundantly clear that\\nif an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of\\nthe common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew\\nto be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time\\nof the committing of that offence is a member of such an assembly, is guilty of that\\noffence, however if a person is a mere bystander, and no speciﬁc role is attributed to\\nhim, he may not come under the wide sweep contemplated under section 149.92.\\nFurther where the member had no knowledge of the unlawful object of the assembly or\\nafter having gained knowledge, he attempted to prevent the assembly from\\naccomplishing the unlawful object, and after having failed to do so, he disassociated\\nhimself from the assembly, the mere participation of him in such an assembly would\\nnot be made him liable.93.\\nThe section constitutes a substantive offence.94.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 560}),\n",

If an offence is committed by any member of\\nan unlawful assembly in prosecution of a common object thereof or such as the members\\nof that assembly knew that the offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of that\\nobject, every person who at the time of committing that offence was member would be\\nguilty of the offence committed. The common object may be commission of one offence\\nwhile there may be likelihood of commission of yet another offence, the knowledge whereof\\nis capable of being safely attributable to the members of the unlawful assembly. Whether a\\nmember of such unlawful assembly was aware as regards likelihood of commission of\\nanother offence or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\\nBackground of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms\\ncarried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour of the\\nmembers soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime would be relevant\\nfactors for drawing an inference in that behalf.\"95. \"Common object\" means the purpose or\\ndesign shared by all the members which may be formed at any stage. It has to be\\nascertained from the acts and conduct of the individuals concerned and surrounding\\ncircumstances.96. Common object to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis\\nthat the weapons carried by the accused were dangerous.97.\\n[s 149.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe section has the following essentials—\\n1. There must be an unlawful assembly.\\n2. Commission of an offence by any member of an unlawful assembly.\\n3. Such offence must have been committed in prosecution of the common object of\\nthe assembly; or must be such as the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be\\ncommitted. If these three elements are satisﬁed, then only a conviction under section\\n149, IPC, 1860, may be substantiated, and not otherwise.98. Section 149 shall not apply\\nto a person who is merely present in any unlawful assembly, unless he actively\\nparticipates in offence or does some overt act with the necessary criminal intention or\\nshares the common object of the unlawful assembly.99.\\n[s 149.2] Sudden action of one of the member in the assembly; all are not\\nliable:\\nTo the question whether the sudden action of one of the members of the unlawful\\nassembly constitutes an act in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful\\nassembly namely preventing of erection of the fence in question and whether the\\nmembers of the unlawful assembly knew that such an offence was likely to be\\ncommitted by any member of the assembly Supreme Court answered in the\\nnegative.100.

Section 34 of IPC, 1860 refers to cases in\\nwhich several persons both do an act and intend to do that act: it does not refer to\\ncases where several persons intend to do an act and some one or more of them do an\\nentirely different act. In the latter class of cases section 149 of the Code may be\\napplicable but section 34 is not.103. On the other hand, if ﬁve or more persons both do\\nan act and intend to do it, both section 34 and section 149, may apply, since the term\\n\"member\" in the singular includes the plural also (section 9). In this connection see\\ndetailed discussion and cases under sub-head \"Distinction between section 34 and\\nsection 149, IPC, 1860,\" under section 34 ante.\\n[s 149.4] Scope.—\\nThis section is not intended to subject a member of an unlawful assembly to\\npunishment for every offence which is committed by one of its members during the\\ntime they are engaged in the prosecution of the common object. It is divided into two\\nparts: (1) an offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution\\nof the common object of that assembly; and (2) an offence such as the members of\\nthat assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object\\nof the unlawful assembly, is one which the accused knew would be likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object.104. The section applies equally in\\ncases where offences are committed by single member of the assembly and in cases\\nwhere offences are committed by two or more members of the assembly acting in\\nfurtherance of a common intention.105.\\nOnce the Court can ﬁnd that an offence has been committed by some member or\\nmembers of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object, then whether\\nthe principal offender has been convicted for that offence or not, upon the plain\\nwording of this section, the other members may be constructively convicted of that\\noffence, provided they are found to have had the necessary intention or knowledge. It is\\nnot correct to say that when a member of an unlawful assembly is to be found\\nconstructively guilty of an offence under this section, it must be the same offence of\\nwhich the principal is convicted and not some other offence.106.\\nMembers of an unlawful assembly may have a community of object only up to a certain\\npoint, beyond which they may differ in their objects, and the knowledge possessed by\\neach member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object\\nwill vary, not only according to the information at his command, but also according to\\nthe extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this\\nthe effect of this section may be different on different members of the same unlawful\\nassembly.107.\\nBefore this section can be called in aid, the Court must ﬁnd with \\'certainty\\' that there\\nwere at least ﬁve persons sharing the common object. A ﬁnding that three of them\\n\\'may or may not have been there\\' betrays uncertainty on this vital point and it\\nconsequently becomes impossible to allow the conviction to rest on this uncertain\\nfoundation. This is not to say that ﬁve persons must always be convicted before this\\nsection can be applied. It is possible in some cases for Judges to conclude that though\\nﬁve were unquestionably there the identity of one or more is in doubt. In that case, the\\nconviction of the rest with the aid of this section would be good.108. Non-applicability', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 562}),\n",

It would depend on the facts of each\\ncase as to whether section 34 or section 149 of IPC or both the provisions are\\nattracted.109. Where the accused, forming an unlawful assembly, chased and killed a\\nman by inﬂicting multiple injuries on his body with sharp edged weapons, it was held\\nthat circumstances and transaction taken as a whole were suﬃcient to invoke section\\n34 or section 149.110.\\nNo judgment can be cited as a precedent however similar the facts may be. Each case\\nmust rest on its own facts.111.\\nThe persons acting in self-defence of property cannot be members of an unlawful\\nassembly.112.\\n1. \\'In prosecution of the common object\\'.—The expression \"in prosecution of common\\nobject\" has to be strictly construed as equivalent to \"in order to attain the common\\nobject\". There must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a\\nparticular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may have\\ncommunity of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ in their objects\\nand the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information at\\nhis command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of\\nobject, and as a consequence of this the effect of section 149, IPC, 1860, may be\\ndifferent on different members of the same assembly.113. The word \"knew\" as used in\\nthe second branch of section 149 implied something more than \"possibility\" and it\\ncannot bear the sense of \"might have known\". An offence committed in prosecution of\\ncommon object would generally be the offence which the members of the assembly\\nknew was likely to be committed.114. This phrase means that the offence committed\\nwas immediately connected with the common object of the unlawful assembly, of\\nwhich the accused were members. The act must be one which must have been done\\nwith a view to accomplish the common object attributed to the members of the\\nunlawful assembly. Where the common object is established, the unlawful assembly\\ndoes not cease to be so by merely splitting itself into two groups for launching the\\nattack. Section 149, IPC, 1860, would be clearly applicable to such a case.115.\\nThe words \"in prosecution of the common object\" do not mean \"during the prosecution\\nof the common object of the assembly\". It means that the offence committed was\\nimmediately connected with the common object of the assembly or the act is one\\nwhich upon the evidence appears to have been done with a view to accomplish the\\ncommon object attributed to the members of the assembly. The words \"in prosecution\\nof the common object\" have to be strictly construed as equivalent to \"in order to attain\\ncommon object\".116. In the present case,117. the common object of unlawful assembly\\nwas to kill a particular person. Two members of the assembly went after him. Sensing\\ndanger, he ran into the adjoining room to fetch a spear to defend himself. His wife\\nblocked his way and he could not come out. Frustrated, as they were, the two members\\nof the assembly gunned down two young girls of their intended victim who were then\\nplaying in the courtyard outside the house. The conviction of the rest of the members\\nfor this murder was set aside as this was neither their common object, nor incidental to\\nthat, nor necessary for its attainment.\\nVicarious responsibility can be fastened only on proof that the ultimate act was done in\\npursuance of common object.118.\\nEven where the common object is not developed at the initial stage, it may develop on\\nthe spot, eoinstanti.

Where, however, the agreement speciﬁcally was only to give a\\nthrashing to the victim, but one of them pulled out a knife and stabbed the victim, it was\\nheld that neither at the initial stage nor at the execution stage, could it be said that\\nthere was the object to cause a fatal injury so as to make all others liable for the\\ndeath.120.\\n[s 149.5] Change of object.—\\nMembers who shared the original common intention may not be liable when some\\nmembers adopted a subsequently developed and aggravated common object and\\nacted on it.121.\\n[s 149.6] CASES.—Prosecution of common object.—\\nWhile membership of an unlawful assembly itself is an offence under section 143, IPC,\\n1860, use of force by members of the unlawful assembly gives rise to the offence of\\nrioting which is punishable either under section 147 or section 148, IPC. Membership\\nof the 4 accused in the unlawful assembly and use of force with dangerous weapons is\\nborne out by the evidence on record. The said facts would make the acquitted accused\\nliable for the offence under section 148 of IPC, 1860.122. Where a small compact body\\nof men armed with clubs, and headed by a man carrying a gun, endeavoured to take\\nforcible possession of certain lands, and one of the opponents was shot by their leader,\\nit was held that they were guilty of murder.123.\\nWhere in a faction- ridden village the members of one party seeing someone of the\\nother party alighting from a bus emerged together to attack him, it could be easily said\\nthat they shared the common object to assault one of their enemies and at that stage\\nthe assembly turned into an unlawful assembly.124. Where several persons assaulted\\nand caused injuries to the deceased, however except one incised injury on the head, all\\nwere lacerated injuries on legs, common object of the unlawful assembly was held to\\ncause grievous hurt and not murder and conviction of the accused was altered from\\nsections 302/ 149 to sections 326/149.125. Where the accused, being members of an\\nunlawful assembly and being armed with sharp edged weapons, used only the blunt\\nsides of their weapons, they were held to share the common object of causing grievous\\nhurt and not murder.57 Accused persons variously armed entered a police wireless\\nstation after breaking open doors and windows and assaulted inmates.

The three others were punished under section 398/149, their common object\\nbeing dacoity and not murder.129.\\nThe accused persons were armed with lathis and guns.

In these circumstances they caused death. s\\nconviction under section 300 read with section 149 was held to be not illegal.130.\\nThere is no requirement for conviction under the section of assigning deﬁnite roles to\\nthe accused persons.131.\\n[s 149.7] Identiﬁcation of all the ﬁve not necessary.—\\nThe section does not require that all the ﬁve persons must be identiﬁed. Presence of\\nﬁve persons is required to be established with the common object of doing an act. The\\nfact that all of them could not be identiﬁed would not affect the application of the\\nsection. The eye-witnesses identiﬁed only four of them but testiﬁed that others were\\npresent with weapons at the time and place of occurrence.\\n[s 149.8] Unlawful assembly and the right of private defence.—\\nAs long as the accused persons exercised their right of private defence, their assembly\\ncould not be described as unlawful. But only those accused persons who shared the\\nobject of doing something in excess of the right of private defence were liable to\\nconviction with the help of section 149.132. Where the accused persons were acting in\\nthe exercise of the right of private defence, the Supreme Court said that they could not\\nbe said to have constituted an unlawful assembly. Only one of them caused an injury\\nafter the right of private defence had ceased to be available to them. They could not be\\nconvicted under section 148 with the aid of section 149.133.\\n[s 149.9] Overt act on the part of each and every member not necessary.—\\nThe presence of the accused as a part of the unlawful assembly is suﬃcient for his\\nconviction. The fact that the accused was present at the place of occurrence as a part\\nof the unlawful assembly was not disputed. That was held to be suﬃcient to hold him\\nguilty even if no overt act was attributed to him.134. This principle may not apply where\\nthe presence is such that merely by its reason the person concerned does not become\\na member of the assembly.

Intention of members of unlawful assembly can be gathered by nature,\\nnumber and location of injuries inﬂicted. In the instant case, repeated gun shots ﬁred\\nby one of accused person on the person of deceased and the injuries caused by lathis\\nby other accused persons on the complainant and his second brother on their heads,\\nclearly demonstrate the objective to cause murder of these persons.137. Common\\nobject to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis that the weapons\\ncarried by the accused were dangerous.138. The common object of assembly is\\nnormally to be gathered from the circumstances of each case such as the time and\\nplace of the gathering of the assembly, the conduct of the gathering as distinguished\\nfrom the conduct of the individual members are indicative of the common object of the\\ngathering. Assessing the common object of an assembly only on the basis of the overt\\nacts committed by such individual members of the assembly is impermissible.139.\\n[s 149.11] Identiﬁcation of common object.—\\nThe identiﬁcation of the common object essentially requires an assessment of the\\nstate of mind of the members of the unlawful assembly. Proof of such mental\\ncondition is normally established by inferential logic. If a large number of people gather\\nat a public place at the dead of night armed with deadly weapons like axes and ﬁre\\narms and attack another person or group of persons, any member of the attacking\\ngroup would have to be a moron in intelligence if he did not know murder would be a\\nlikely consequence.140.\\n[s 149.12] No common object.—\\nA large body of men belonging to one faction waylaid another body of men belonging\\nto a second faction, and a ﬁght ensued, in the course of which a member of the ﬁrst\\nmentioned faction was wounded and retired to the side of the road, taking no further\\nactive part in the affray. After his retirement a member of the second faction was killed.\\nIt was held that the wounded man had ceased to be a member of the unlawful\\nassembly when he retired wounded, and that he could not, under this section, be made\\nliable for the subsequent murder.141. Where the accused persons rushed to the house\\nof K with a view to injure K or inmates of his house but one of the accused attacked M,\\na woman working in the house causing grievous injuries to her, the other accused\\npersons could not be held vicariously liable with the help of section 149, IPC, 1860, as it\\nwas not their common object nor had they any animus against M.142.

The rule of requirement of more than one witness applies only in a case\\nwhere a witness deposes in a general and vague manner or in the case of a riot.150.\\nDirect evidence is generally not available.

It was\\nheld that when there is no separate charge for the offence under section 302 simpliciter\\nand charge is only for the offence under section 302 read with 149, the conviction for\\nthe offence under section 302 simpliciter is not sustainable.

In such a\\ncase, even though the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section\\n149 of IPC and there is not even an alternate charge for the offence under section 302\\nsimpliciter, when the charge discloses the overt act by a particular accused which\\ncaused the death of the victim, if the evidence establishes that, that particular accused\\ninﬂicted that particular injury which caused the death, he could deﬁnitely be convicted\\nfor the offence under section 302 simpliciter. Even though there is no speciﬁc charge\\nfor section 302 simpliciter and the charge is for the offence under section 302 read\\nwith 149 of IPC, there could be a conviction under section 302 simpliciter.\\n[s 149.15] Where no charge framed as substantive offence with aid of either\\nsection 34 and section 149.—\\nWhere participation of all the ten accused in the alleged assault on the deceased has\\nbeen proved by the evidence of witnesses, but no charge insofar as the substantive\\noffence under section 302, IPC, 1860, or under section 307, IPC with the aid of either\\nsection 34, IPC and section 149, IPC had been framed and also the evidence on record\\nis not suﬃcient to attribute any speciﬁc injury suffered by the deceased to any\\nparticular accused, acquittal of the accused of the offences under section 302, IPC or\\nunder section 307, IPC is perfectly justiﬁed.157.\\n[s 149.16] Free ﬁght and overt act.—\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that in a case involving free ﬁght, a conviction by\\nresorting to section 149 is not permissible.

Where after\\na close scrutiny of the evidence, a reasonable doubt arises in the mind of the court with\\nregard to the participation of any of those who have been roped in, the court would be\\nobliged to give the beneﬁt of doubt to them.160.

In this section the assembly need\\nnot be an \\'unlawful assembly\\' but if it is likely to cause a disturbance of the public\\npeace, then joining or continuing in such assembly after it has been commanded to\\ndisperse is punishable. Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code confers on a\\nMagistrate and an oﬃcer in charge of a police-station the power to disperse an\\nunlawful assembly or any assembly of ﬁve or more persons likely to cause a\\ndisturbance of the public peace. A bare reading of section 129, Cr PC, 1973, would\\nmake it abundantly clear that a lawful procession or assembly cannot be regarded as\\nlikely to cause a breach of the peace when it is admitted that not they but some other\\nbody of persons is bent on attacking them. Whether an assembly is likely to cause a\\ndisturbance of public peace has to be judged from its own acts and behaviour and not\\nfrom the behaviour of another hostile group whose physical opposition may cause a\\nbreach of the peace.164. \"Thus, if an assembly other than an unlawful assembly\\nbehaves in such a manner as to provoke a breach of the peace by its own conduct or\\naction, there would be a justiﬁcation to order it to disperse under the powers given by\\nsection 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if a religious assembly or procession\\nremains peaceful in the enjoyment of its legitimate rights and privileges under the law,\\nit should not be ordered to disperse merely because a body of antagonistic persons\\ntake it into their heads to attack it with a view to provoke a riot. In such a case, it is\\nrather that body of aggressive persons that constitutes an unlawful assembly and\\nrequires to be sternly dealt with under the law\".165.

The offence under this section involves some\\nact of origination of a riot by doing an illegal act infuriating to the feelings of those who\\nultimately come to riot. The expression \"gives provocation\" connotes such idea. This\\nsection is intended to apply to such provocative words or acts as do not amount\\ndirectly to instigation or abetment.168.

The adverbs \\'maliciously\\' and\\n\\'malignantly\\' are synonymous. Malice is not, as in ordinary speech, only an expression\\nof hatred or ill-will to an individual, but means an unlawful act done intentionally\\nwithout just cause or excuse.172. Malignant means extreme malevolence or enmity;\\nviolently hostile or harmful.\\n2. \\'Wantonly\\'.— means recklessly, thoughtlessly, without regard for right or\\nconsequences. This word gives to the offence contained in this section a far larger,\\nvaguer and more comprehensive scope, than would be implied by the word\\n\\'malignantly\\' standing alone. It occurs only in this section of the Code, while the word\\n\\'malignantly\\' occurs once again in section 270.\\n[s 153.2] CASES.—\\nThe aﬃxing of the poster exhorting for boycotting the election, even if it is\\nobjectionable, is not suﬃcient to show that by such aﬃxture provocation is given to any\\nperson for causing the offence of rioting. Howsoever deplorable be the act of aﬃxing\\nthe poster, to constitute the offence under section 153 of IPC, 1860, over and above the\\nprovocation that is likely to give cause for rioting, it has to be shown that the act —\\naﬃxing of the poster —is illegal.173.\\nWhere the accused wrote a pamphlet in praise of a person who was opposed to the\\nHigh Priest of the Borah community in certain matters, but his real intention appeared\\nto be to show a grave insult to the High Priest, an insult which was likely to inﬂame the\\nfeelings of the followers of the High Priest and to lead to a riot, it was held that he was\\nguilty under this section.174. Where a bride and bridegroom belonging to depressed\\nclasses rode in palanquins through a village in spite of the protests of high caste\\nHindus, it was held that this was not an illegal act for which they could be convicted\\nunder this section.175.

Sub-section (1)(c) has been\\nnewly inserted by Act 31 of 1972. This section provides for enhanced punishment for\\noffences committed in a place of worship and making offences under this section\\ncognisable. Under this section promoting enmity between different groups on grounds\\nsuch as, place of birth, or residence are included and it also makes promotion of\\ndisharmony or feelings of ill-will an offence punishable under it. The provision in clause\\n(b) of sub-section (1) to the section includes acts prejudicial to the maintenance of\\nharmony between different regional groups and sub-section (2) provides for enhanced\\npunishment for any offence speciﬁed in sub-section (1) when it is committed in a place\\nof worship, etc. With communal and ﬁssiparous tendencies on the increase this section\\nhas now gained an added importance. The object of section 153-A is to prevent\\nbreaches of the public tranquillity which might result from excited feelings of enmity\\nbetween classes of people. Absence of malicious intention is a relevant factor to judge\\nwhether the offence is committed.180.\\nSection 153A of IPC, 1860, covers a case where a person by words, either spoken or\\nwritten, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to\\npromote, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious,\\nracial, language or regional groups or castes or communities or acts prejudicial to the\\nmaintenance of harmony or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity. The gist of the\\noffence is the intention to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different\\nclasses of people. The intention to cause disorder or incite the people to violence is the\\nsine qua non of the offence under section 153A of IPC and the prosecution has to prove\\nprima facie the existence of mens rea on the part of the accused.181. The intention to\\ncause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under\\nsection 153A IPC and the prosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 588}),\n",

In this case, the prosecution has not been able to establish any mens rea\\non the part of the appellants as envisaged by the provisions of section 153A IPC, by\\ntheir raising casually the slogans a couple of times. The offence under section 153A\\nIPC is, therefore, not made out.182.\\nThere must either be the intention to promote such feelings, or such feelings should be\\npromoted as the result of words spoken or written. The words promotes or tends to\\npromote feelings of enmity are to be read as connoting a successful or unsuccessful\\nattempt to promote feelings of enmity. It must be the purpose or parts of the purpose\\nof the accused to promote such feelings, and, if it is no part of his purpose, the mere\\ncircumstance that there may be a tendency is not suﬃcient.183. The word classes\\nincludes any deﬁnite and ascertainable class of people. Capitalists do not constitute a\\nclass within the meaning of this section.184. To bring any body of persons within the\\ndescription of a class of people, the body of persons must possess a certain degree of\\nimportance numerically, and must be ascertained with certainty and distinguished from\\nany other class. Every group of persons cannot be designated as a class.185. The\\nclasses contemplated must be not merely clearly deﬁned and separable but also\\nnumerous. A small and limited group of Zamindars cannot be regarded as constituting\\na class.186. Petitioner published a sentence \"Oriya is a younger sister of Bengal\" in his\\nbook. Subsequently petitioner published an apology in newspaper and deleted the\\ncontroversial statement. In view of this it cannot be said that alleged sentence\\npublished to defame Oriya language or promote hatred between different linguistic\\ngroups. Criminal proceeding are quashed.187.\\nThe police force of the State cannot be brought within the purview of the term\\n\"community\".188.\\n[s 153A.1] Political Thesis.—\\nThis section cannot be used even if an article causes or tends to cause hatred or\\nenmity between different political classes like the capitalists and the labour class or\\nbetween persons believing in different forms of Government, e.g., a democratic or\\ntotalitarian rule. A bare reading of clause (a) of section 153A will show that a person\\nwill be guilty under this section only where by words, either spoken or written, he\\npromotes or attempts to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different\\nreligious, racial, linguistic groups or castes or communities on grounds of religion, race,\\nlanguage, caste or community, etc., and not otherwise.189. But where the author in the\\nguise of presenting a political thesis or historical truth wrote two articles describing the\\nMuslims as a basically violent race and further described today\\'s Muslims as the\\ndescendants of foul Moghuls rulers who were lustful perverts, rapists and murderers, it\\nwas held that both the articles promoted feelings of enmity between Hindus and\\nMuslims and came within the mischief of section 153A IPC, 1860, whether or not the\\nMoghuls were really so.190. In ﬁne, this section does not contemplate the penalising of\\npolitical doctrines, even though of the extreme kind like communism, but only such\\nwritings as directly promote feelings of hatred or enmity between classes. But if a\\npublication advocates forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions, and aims at\\npromoting class hatred and enmity, it comes under the purview of this section.191.\\n1. Historical Account.—If the writing is calculated to promote feelings of enmity or\\nhatred, it is no defence to a charge under section 153-A of IPC, 1860, that the writing\\ncontains a truthful account of past events or is otherwise supported by good authority.\\nAdherence to the strict path of history is not by itself a complete defence to a charge\\nunder section 153-A. It is no defence to a charge under section 153-A of IPC that the\\nwriting contains a truthful account of past events or is otherwise supported by good\\nauthority.192.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 589}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='But it would be no offence if the author adheres to the historical part of his narrative,\\nhowever unpalatable it may be to the members of the other community, but if he uses\\nlanguage which shows malice and is bound to annoy the members of the other\\ncommunity so as to degrade them in the eyes of the other classes, he is promoting\\nfeelings of enmity and hatred and is liable to be dealt with under this section and\\nsection 295- A.193. It is, therefore, important to remember that criminality under section\\n153A does not attach to the thing said or done but to the manner in which it is said or\\ndone. If the words spoken or written are couched in temperate language and do not\\nhave the tendency to insult the feelings or the deepest religious convictions of any\\nsection of the people, penal consequences do not follow.194. This appears also to be\\nthe law in England in regard to blasphemous libel. Thus, in Lemon\\'s case Lord Diplock\\nobserved:\\nTo publish opinion denying the truth of the established church or even of Christianity itself\\nwas no longer held to amount to the offence of blasphemous libel so long as such opinions\\nwere expressed in temperate language and not in terms of offence, insult or ridicule.195.\\nSo what is said or written is not so important as how it is said or written or with what\\nintent it is said or written. Where, therefore, the article did not intend or exhibit any\\ninsult to any religion but read as a whole projected a scholarly historical thesis showing\\nas to how in pre-Islamic times the ancient Hindu culture and Hindu religion were in\\nvogue in Arabia and how Islamic culture, religion and art were greatly inﬂuenced by\\nIndian culture and religion, it could not be said that the article came within the mischief\\nof section 153A, IPC, 1860, or section 95, Cr PC, 1973. The scope of section 153A, IPC,\\ncannot be enlarged to such an extent with a view to thwart history or historical\\nevents.196.\\nWhere an article in a newspaper bears a meaning that is calculated to produce hatred\\nand enmity between two classes, the natural inference from the publication of such an\\narticle is that the person who published it had the malicious intention that it should\\nproduce such hatred and enmity.197. A Hindu, who ridicules the Prophet of the\\nMohammedans not out of any eccentricity but in the prosecution of a propaganda\\nstarted by a class of persons who are not Mohammedans, promotes feelings of enmity\\nand hatred between Hindus and Mohammedans, and is liable to punishment under the\\nsection.198. In order to ascertain the intention of the accused, the offending article\\nmust be read as a whole and the circumstances attending that publication must also\\nbe taken into account.199.\\nAn FIR was ﬁled against the author, publisher and printer of the book \"Shivaji: Hindu\\nKing in Islamic India\" on the ground that certain passage were objectionable. This led\\nto blackening of the face of a local scholar, ransacking of a research institute and\\ndestruction of manuscripts, etc. The members of the institute had helped the author\\nmade contributions to enable the author to complete the work. The author was an\\nAmerican professor based in the USA. He tendered apology, by fax and the publishers\\nimmediately withdrew all the copies from the market. In proceedings against the\\nauthor, etc., it was held that the book was purely a scholarly pursuit. There was no\\nintention or motive to create trouble for the author and others. The State was directed\\nnot to proceed against them. The Supreme Court explained the gist of the offence\\nunder the section as follows:\\nThe gist of the offence under section 153-A is the intention to promote feelings of\\nenmity or hatred between different classes of people. The intention to cause disorder\\nor incite the people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under section 153-A\\nIPC, 1860, and the prosecution has to prove prima facie the existence of mens rea on\\nthe part of the accused. The intention has to be judged primarily by the language of the\\nbook and the circumstances in which the book was written and published. The matter\\ncomplained of to fall within the ambit of section 153-A must be read as a whole. One', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 590}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='cannot rely on strongly worded and isolated passage for proving the charge nor indeed\\ncan one take a sentence here and a sentence there and connect them by a meticulous\\nprocess of inferential reasoning.\\nThe effect of the words must be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-\\nminded, ﬁrm and courageous men, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of\\nthose who scent danger in every hostile point of view. It is the standard of the ordinary\\nreasonable man or as they say in English law \"the man on the top of a Clapham\\nomnibus\".\\nThe common feature in both the sections, viz., sections 153-A and 505(2), being\\npromotion of feeling of enmity, hatred or ill-will \"between different\" religious or racial or\\nlinguistic or regional groups or castes and communities, it is necessary that at least\\ntwo such groups or communities should be involved. Merely inciting the feeling of one\\ncommunity or group without any reference to any other community or group cannot\\nattract either of the two sections.200. In State of Maharashtra v Sangharaj Damodar\\nRupawate,201. the Supreme Court again considered the question whether a notiﬁcation\\nissued by the Maharashtra Government to forfeit the book \"Shivaji: Hindu King in\\nIslamic India\". It was held that the notiﬁcation does not identify the communities\\nbetween which the book had caused or is likely to cause enmity. It cannot be found out\\nfrom the notiﬁcation as to which communities got outraged by the publication of the\\nbook or it had had caused hatred and animosity between the particular communities or\\ngroups—statement in the notiﬁcation to the effect that the book is \\'likely to result in\\nbreach of peace and public tranquillity and in particular between those who revere Shri\\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and those who may not\\' is too vague a ground to satisfy the\\naforesaid tests. The order quashing the notiﬁcation was upheld by the Supreme Court.\\nIn Ramesh Chotalal Dalal v UOI,202. the Court held that TV serial \"Tamas\" did not depict\\ncommunal tension and violence and the provisions of section 153A of IPC, 1860, would\\nnot apply to it. It was also not prejudicial to the national integration falling under\\nsection 153B of IPC. Approving the observations of Vivian Bose, J in Bhagvati Charan\\nShukla v Provincial Government,203. the Court observed that the effect of the words\\nmust be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-minded, ﬁrm and courageous\\nmen, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of those who scent danger in\\nevery hostile point of view. It is the standard of ordinary reasonable man or as they say\\nin English Law, \"the man on the clapham omnibus\". Again in Bilal Ahmed Kaloo v State\\nof AP,204. it was held that the common feature in both the sections, viz., sections 153A\\nand 505 (2), being promotion of feeling of enmity, hatred or ill-will \"between different\"\\nreligious or racial or linguistic or regional groups or castes and communities, it is\\nnecessary that at least two such groups or communities should be involved. Further, it\\nwas observed that merely inciting the feeling of one community or group without any\\nreference to any other community or group cannot attract either of the two sections.\\n2. Scurrilous attack on basic religious books.—Section 153A certainly affords\\nprotection to the basic religious books of all the religions against scurrilous attacks. In\\nChandanmal Chopra v State of WB,205. it was alleged that the Koran, the basic religious\\nbook of Muslim religion promotes religious disharmony by advocating destructions of\\nidols, etc., and thereby outrages not only the religious feelings of non-Muslims but also\\nencourages hatred, disharmony, feeling of enmity between different religious\\ncommunities in India, and the petitioner sought for directing the State of West Bengal\\nto forfeit every copy of Koran. It was also alleged that the publication of Koran amounts\\nto commission of offences punishable under sections 153A and 295A of IPC, 1860. In\\nsupport of their contention the petitioners quoted some isolated passages from the\\nKoran. In rejecting this contention the High Court of Calcutta held that sections 153A\\nand 295A of the Code have no application in the present case. The book is the basic\\ntext book of the Mohammedans and is held sacred by them like Bible to Christians and\\nGita, Ramayana and Mahabharata to Hindus.

Evidence of hatred, etc., not needed.—A Special Bench of the Bombay High Court\\nhas held that under this section it is not necessary to prove that as a result of the\\nobjectionable matter, enmity or hatred was in fact caused between the different\\nclasses.

It is enough to show that the language of the\\nwriting is of a nature calculated to promote feelings of enmity or hatred for a person\\nmust be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act. If a writing is\\ncalculated to promote feelings of enmity or hatred, it is no defence to a charge under\\nthis section that the writing contains a truthful account of past events or is otherwise\\nsupported by good authority. Adherence to the strict path of history is not by itself a\\ncomplete defence to a charge under this section.206.\\nImmediately after the demolition of Babri masjid and violent riots in Bombay, editorials\\nappeared in the Marathi newspaper 'Samna' which were in high ﬂown and caustic\\nlanguage but were not directed against the Muslim Community as a whole but only\\nagainst anti-national elements amongst them and also against the attitude of police,\\narmy and Government.

Sub-section (1)(c) has been\\nnewly inserted by Act 31 of 1972. This section provides for enhanced punishment for\\noffences committed in a place of worship and making offences under this section\\ncognisable. Under this section promoting enmity between different groups on grounds\\nsuch as, place of birth, or residence are included and it also makes promotion of\\ndisharmony or feelings of ill-will an offence punishable under it. The provision in clause\\n(b) of sub-section (1) to the section includes acts prejudicial to the maintenance of\\nharmony between different regional groups and sub-section (2) provides for enhanced\\npunishment for any offence speciﬁed in sub-section (1) when it is committed in a place\\nof worship, etc. With communal and ﬁssiparous tendencies on the increase this section\\nhas now gained an added importance. The object of section 153-A is to prevent\\nbreaches of the public tranquillity which might result from excited feelings of enmity\\nbetween classes of people. Absence of malicious intention is a relevant factor to judge\\nwhether the offence is committed.180.\\nSection 153A of IPC, 1860, covers a case where a person by words, either spoken or\\nwritten, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to\\npromote, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious,\\nracial, language or regional groups or castes or communities or acts prejudicial to the\\nmaintenance of harmony or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity. The gist of the\\noffence is the intention to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different\\nclasses of people. The intention to cause disorder or incite the people to violence is the\\nsine qua non of the offence under section 153A of IPC and the prosecution has to prove\\nprima facie the existence of mens rea on the part of the accused.181. The intention to\\ncause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under\\nsection 153A IPC and the prosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 596}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='to succeed. In this case, the prosecution has not been able to establish any mens rea\\non the part of the appellants as envisaged by the provisions of section 153A IPC, by\\ntheir raising casually the slogans a couple of times. The offence under section 153A\\nIPC is, therefore, not made out.182.\\nThere must either be the intention to promote such feelings, or such feelings should be\\npromoted as the result of words spoken or written. The words promotes or tends to\\npromote feelings of enmity are to be read as connoting a successful or unsuccessful\\nattempt to promote feelings of enmity. It must be the purpose or parts of the purpose\\nof the accused to promote such feelings, and, if it is no part of his purpose, the mere\\ncircumstance that there may be a tendency is not suﬃcient.183. The word classes\\nincludes any deﬁnite and ascertainable class of people. Capitalists do not constitute a\\nclass within the meaning of this section.184. To bring any body of persons within the\\ndescription of a class of people, the body of persons must possess a certain degree of\\nimportance numerically, and must be ascertained with certainty and distinguished from\\nany other class. Every group of persons cannot be designated as a class.185. The\\nclasses contemplated must be not merely clearly deﬁned and separable but also\\nnumerous. A small and limited group of Zamindars cannot be regarded as constituting\\na class.186. Petitioner published a sentence \"Oriya is a younger sister of Bengal\" in his\\nbook. Subsequently petitioner published an apology in newspaper and deleted the\\ncontroversial statement. In view of this it cannot be said that alleged sentence\\npublished to defame Oriya language or promote hatred between different linguistic\\ngroups. Criminal proceeding are quashed.187.\\nThe police force of the State cannot be brought within the purview of the term\\n\"community\".188.\\n[s 153A.1] Political Thesis.—\\nThis section cannot be used even if an article causes or tends to cause hatred or\\nenmity between different political classes like the capitalists and the labour class or\\nbetween persons believing in different forms of Government, e.g., a democratic or\\ntotalitarian rule. A bare reading of clause (a) of section 153A will show that a person\\nwill be guilty under this section only where by words, either spoken or written, he\\npromotes or attempts to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different\\nreligious, racial, linguistic groups or castes or communities on grounds of religion, race,\\nlanguage, caste or community, etc., and not otherwise.189. But where the author in the\\nguise of presenting a political thesis or historical truth wrote two articles describing the\\nMuslims as a basically violent race and further described today\\'s Muslims as the\\ndescendants of foul Moghuls rulers who were lustful perverts, rapists and murderers, it\\nwas held that both the articles promoted feelings of enmity between Hindus and\\nMuslims and came within the mischief of section 153A IPC, 1860, whether or not the\\nMoghuls were really so.190. In ﬁne, this section does not contemplate the penalising of\\npolitical doctrines, even though of the extreme kind like communism, but only such\\nwritings as directly promote feelings of hatred or enmity between classes. But if a\\npublication advocates forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions, and aims at\\npromoting class hatred and enmity, it comes under the purview of this section.191.\\n1. Historical Account.—If the writing is calculated to promote feelings of enmity or\\nhatred, it is no defence to a charge under section 153-A of IPC, 1860, that the writing\\ncontains a truthful account of past events or is otherwise supported by good authority.\\nAdherence to the strict path of history is not by itself a complete defence to a charge\\nunder section 153-A. It is no defence to a charge under section 153-A of IPC that the\\nwriting contains a truthful account of past events or is otherwise supported by good\\nauthority.192.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 597}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='But it would be no offence if the author adheres to the historical part of his narrative,\\nhowever unpalatable it may be to the members of the other community, but if he uses\\nlanguage which shows malice and is bound to annoy the members of the other\\ncommunity so as to degrade them in the eyes of the other classes, he is promoting\\nfeelings of enmity and hatred and is liable to be dealt with under this section and\\nsection 295- A.193. It is, therefore, important to remember that criminality under section\\n153A does not attach to the thing said or done but to the manner in which it is said or\\ndone. If the words spoken or written are couched in temperate language and do not\\nhave the tendency to insult the feelings or the deepest religious convictions of any\\nsection of the people, penal consequences do not follow.194. This appears also to be\\nthe law in England in regard to blasphemous libel. Thus, in Lemon\\'s case Lord Diplock\\nobserved:\\nTo publish opinion denying the truth of the established church or even of Christianity itself\\nwas no longer held to amount to the offence of blasphemous libel so long as such opinions\\nwere expressed in temperate language and not in terms of offence, insult or ridicule.195.\\nSo what is said or written is not so important as how it is said or written or with what\\nintent it is said or written. Where, therefore, the article did not intend or exhibit any\\ninsult to any religion but read as a whole projected a scholarly historical thesis showing\\nas to how in pre-Islamic times the ancient Hindu culture and Hindu religion were in\\nvogue in Arabia and how Islamic culture, religion and art were greatly inﬂuenced by\\nIndian culture and religion, it could not be said that the article came within the mischief\\nof section 153A, IPC, 1860, or section 95, Cr PC, 1973. The scope of section 153A, IPC,\\ncannot be enlarged to such an extent with a view to thwart history or historical\\nevents.196.\\nWhere an article in a newspaper bears a meaning that is calculated to produce hatred\\nand enmity between two classes, the natural inference from the publication of such an\\narticle is that the person who published it had the malicious intention that it should\\nproduce such hatred and enmity.197. A Hindu, who ridicules the Prophet of the\\nMohammedans not out of any eccentricity but in the prosecution of a propaganda\\nstarted by a class of persons who are not Mohammedans, promotes feelings of enmity\\nand hatred between Hindus and Mohammedans, and is liable to punishment under the\\nsection.198. In order to ascertain the intention of the accused, the offending article\\nmust be read as a whole and the circumstances attending that publication must also\\nbe taken into account.199.\\nAn FIR was ﬁled against the author, publisher and printer of the book \"Shivaji: Hindu\\nKing in Islamic India\" on the ground that certain passage were objectionable. This led\\nto blackening of the face of a local scholar, ransacking of a research institute and\\ndestruction of manuscripts, etc. The members of the institute had helped the author\\nmade contributions to enable the author to complete the work. The author was an\\nAmerican professor based in the USA. He tendered apology, by fax and the publishers\\nimmediately withdrew all the copies from the market. In proceedings against the\\nauthor, etc., it was held that the book was purely a scholarly pursuit. There was no\\nintention or motive to create trouble for the author and others. The State was directed\\nnot to proceed against them. The Supreme Court explained the gist of the offence\\nunder the section as follows:\\nThe gist of the offence under section 153-A is the intention to promote feelings of\\nenmity or hatred between different classes of people. The intention to cause disorder\\nor incite the people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under section 153-A\\nIPC, 1860, and the prosecution has to prove prima facie the existence of mens rea on\\nthe part of the accused. The intention has to be judged primarily by the language of the\\nbook and the circumstances in which the book was written and published. The matter\\ncomplained of to fall within the ambit of section 153-A must be read as a whole. One', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 598}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='cannot rely on strongly worded and isolated passage for proving the charge nor indeed\\ncan one take a sentence here and a sentence there and connect them by a meticulous\\nprocess of inferential reasoning.\\nThe effect of the words must be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-\\nminded, ﬁrm and courageous men, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of\\nthose who scent danger in every hostile point of view. It is the standard of the ordinary\\nreasonable man or as they say in English law \"the man on the top of a Clapham\\nomnibus\".\\nThe common feature in both the sections, viz., sections 153-A and 505(2), being\\npromotion of feeling of enmity, hatred or ill-will \"between different\" religious or racial or\\nlinguistic or regional groups or castes and communities, it is necessary that at least\\ntwo such groups or communities should be involved. Merely inciting the feeling of one\\ncommunity or group without any reference to any other community or group cannot\\nattract either of the two sections.200. In State of Maharashtra v Sangharaj Damodar\\nRupawate,201. the Supreme Court again considered the question whether a notiﬁcation\\nissued by the Maharashtra Government to forfeit the book \"Shivaji: Hindu King in\\nIslamic India\". It was held that the notiﬁcation does not identify the communities\\nbetween which the book had caused or is likely to cause enmity. It cannot be found out\\nfrom the notiﬁcation as to which communities got outraged by the publication of the\\nbook or it had had caused hatred and animosity between the particular communities or\\ngroups—statement in the notiﬁcation to the effect that the book is \\'likely to result in\\nbreach of peace and public tranquillity and in particular between those who revere Shri\\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and those who may not\\' is too vague a ground to satisfy the\\naforesaid tests. The order quashing the notiﬁcation was upheld by the Supreme Court.\\nIn Ramesh Chotalal Dalal v UOI,202. the Court held that TV serial \"Tamas\" did not depict\\ncommunal tension and violence and the provisions of section 153A of IPC, 1860, would\\nnot apply to it. It was also not prejudicial to the national integration falling under\\nsection 153B of IPC. Approving the observations of Vivian Bose, J in Bhagvati Charan\\nShukla v Provincial Government,203. the Court observed that the effect of the words\\nmust be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-minded, ﬁrm and courageous\\nmen, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of those who scent danger in\\nevery hostile point of view. It is the standard of ordinary reasonable man or as they say\\nin English Law, \"the man on the clapham omnibus\". Again in Bilal Ahmed Kaloo v State\\nof AP,204. it was held that the common feature in both the sections, viz., sections 153A\\nand 505 (2), being promotion of feeling of enmity, hatred or ill-will \"between different\"\\nreligious or racial or linguistic or regional groups or castes and communities, it is\\nnecessary that at least two such groups or communities should be involved. Further, it\\nwas observed that merely inciting the feeling of one community or group without any\\nreference to any other community or group cannot attract either of the two sections.\\n2. Scurrilous attack on basic religious books.—Section 153A certainly affords\\nprotection to the basic religious books of all the religions against scurrilous attacks. In\\nChandanmal Chopra v State of WB,205. it was alleged that the Koran, the basic religious\\nbook of Muslim religion promotes religious disharmony by advocating destructions of\\nidols, etc., and thereby outrages not only the religious feelings of non-Muslims but also\\nencourages hatred, disharmony, feeling of enmity between different religious\\ncommunities in India, and the petitioner sought for directing the State of West Bengal\\nto forfeit every copy of Koran. It was also alleged that the publication of Koran amounts\\nto commission of offences punishable under sections 153A and 295A of IPC, 1860. In\\nsupport of their contention the petitioners quoted some isolated passages from the\\nKoran. In rejecting this contention the High Court of Calcutta held that sections 153A\\nand 295A of the Code have no application in the present case. The book is the basic\\ntext book of the Mohammedans and is held sacred by them like Bible to Christians and\\nGita, Ramayana and Mahabharata to Hindus.

It is enough to show that the language of the\\nwriting is of a nature calculated to promote feelings of enmity or hatred for a person\\nmust be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act. If a writing is\\ncalculated to promote feelings of enmity or hatred, it is no defence to a charge under\\nthis section that the writing contains a truthful account of past events or is otherwise\\nsupported by good authority. Adherence to the strict path of history is not by itself a\\ncomplete defence to a charge under this section.206.\\nImmediately after the demolition of Babri masjid and violent riots in Bombay, editorials\\nappeared in the Marathi newspaper 'Samna' which were in high ﬂown and caustic\\nlanguage but were not directed against the Muslim Community as a whole but only\\nagainst anti-national elements amongst them and also against the attitude of police,\\narmy and Government. The articles were held to be not coming within the mischief of\\nsection 153-A and section 153-B.207.\\n[s 153A.2] Previous Sanction:\\nPrevious sanction under section 196 Cr PC, 1973, is a must before taking cognizance\\nof the offences under section 153 and 153B IPC, 1860.208.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 600}),\n",

The present section proceeds apparently\\nupon a presumption that, in addition to any such duty, the owner or occupier of land is\\ncognizant in a peculiar way of the designs of those who assemble on his land, and is\\nable not only to give the police notice, but also to prevent and to disperse and suppress\\nthe assembly.212.\\nSection 45 of the Cr PC, 1973, casts upon the owners and occupiers of land the duty of\\npreventing a riot on their lands.\\nKnowledge, on the part of the owner or occupier of the land, of the acts or intentions of\\nthe agent, is not an essential element of an offence under this section, and he may be\\nconvicted under it though he may be in entire ignorance of the acts of his agent or\\nmanager.213. According to some Police Regulations the Police are required to serve a\\nwarning notice on the landlord, owner, occupier or his agent or other person claiming\\ninterest in landed property contemplated in this and the two subsequent sections so\\nthat they may adopt every means in their power to prevent the unlawful assembly or\\nrioting taking place on such property.214. This being a laudable objective there can\\npossibly be no objection to the issuance of such a notice. It should, however, be\\nremembered that a police-oﬃcer cannot and should not in the name of serving such a\\nnotice injunct the owner or occupier, even temporarily, from enjoying his property.215.\\nThe police have no such power under the law. To make a person cognizant about his\\nduties under the law is one thing and to restrain the owner from enjoying his property is\\nentirely a different thing.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 612}),\n",

The next ingredient is that the ﬁghting should have been in public place and\\nthe last ingredient is that the ﬁghting should have disturbed public peace.218.\\n1. 'Two or more persons'.—An affray requires two persons at the least. An unlawful\\nassembly requires ﬁve. The offence of Affray is a ﬁght, i.e., a bilateral act, in which two\\nparties participate and it will not amount to an affray when the party who is assaulted\\nsubmits to the assault without resistance. Again, there must be a deﬁnite disturbance\\nof the public peace due to the ﬁght in the public place to make the offence affray.219.\\n2. 'Fighting in a public place'.—'Public place' is a place where the public go, no matter\\nwhether they have a right to go or not. Many shows are exhibited to the public on\\nprivate property, yet they are frequented by the public—the public go there.220.\\nThe expression 'Fighting' in section 159, IPC, 1860, is used in its ordinary sense and it\\nmeans a combat or quarrel involving exchange of some force or violence, if not blows.\\nMere verbal quarrel or vulgarly abusing sans violence cannot be construed as ﬁghting\\nwhich contemplates bilateral use of violence by two competing parties. Even if there is\\nno exchange of blows, there should be exchange of some violence between the two\\ncontending parties before it can be said that the parties are ﬁghting. If one person uses\\nviolence against another and the other person merely remains passive, it cannot be\\nsaid that there is a ﬁghting, so also, if neither person uses violence against the other\\nbut both the persons indulge in verbal abuses, it does not amount to ﬁghting.221. Mere\\ncausing inconvenience to the public is not suﬃcient.222.\\n3. 'Disturb the public peace'.—An affray is an offence against the public peace because\\nit is committed in a public place and is likely to cause general alarm and disturbance.\\nMere causing public inconvenience is not enough.223. Before a conviction can be\\nentered under section 160, IPC, 1860, there must be a clear ﬁnding by the court that the\\nplace of occurrence was a public place. If there is no such ﬁnding the accused persons\\nmust be acquitted.224.\\n[s 160.2] Affray and riot.—An affray differs from a riot.\\n(1)An affray cannot be committed in a private place, a riot can be.\\n(2)An affray can be committed by two or more persons, a riot, by ﬁve or more.\\n[s 160.3] Affray and assault.—An affray differs from an assault.—\\n(1)The former must be committed in a public place; the latter may take place\\nanywhere.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 624}),\n",

A person who poses as a Government servant and by so doing obtains of\\nanother's services, which he would not otherwise have obtained and which the other\\nperson was bound to give on demand by a Government oﬃcer, commits an offence\\nunder this section.17.\\n3. 'Under colour of such oﬃce'.—An act is done 'under colour of an oﬃce,' if it is an act\\nhaving some relation to the oﬃce, which the actor pretends to hold. If it has no relation\\nto the oﬃce, as if A pretending to be a servant of Government, travelling through a\\ndistrict, obtains money, provisions, etc., the offence may amount to cheating under\\nsection 415, but is not punishable under this section.18. The act done under colour of\\noﬃce must be an act which could not have been done without assuming oﬃcial\\nauthority.\\nWhere the accused posed as a police oﬃcer and in that garb looted certain articles\\nfrom the complainant and the stolen articles, one police ballot and monogram were\\nrecovered from him, his conviction under the section was held to be proper.19.\\n[s 170.2] Retired IAS oﬃcer using IAS with his name.—\\nTo constitute an offence under section 170, a person must either pretend to hold a\\nparticular oﬃce as a public servant knowing that he does not hold such oﬃce or falsely\\npersonate any other person holding such oﬃce. Over and above that, that person in\\nsuch assumed character must do or attempt to do an act under the colour of such\\noﬃce. There must be pretension or false personation to be a particular person, that too\\na public servant, which he is not, and then doing of or attempt to do some act under\\ncolour of such oﬃce of that public servant, to proceed against a person under section\\n170 of the Indian Penal Code. Thus, where a retired IAS oﬃcer, had used IAS in his\\nletterhead when he continued as Director of CAPE and also corresponded in that\\nmanner, is no ground to impute that he has committed an offence under section 170 of\\nthe Penal Code.20.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 647}),\n",

'Absconds'.—This term is not to be understood as implying necessarily that a person\\nleaves the place in which he is. Its etymological and ordinary sense is to hide oneself;\\nand it matters not whether a person departs from a place or remains in it, if he\\nconceals himself. If a person, having concealed himself before process issues,\\ncontinues to do so after it is issued, he absconds.2.\\n2. 'Summons, notice or order'.—The summons, notice or order referred to, should be\\naddressed to the same person whose attendance is required and who absconds to\\navoid being served with such a 'summons, notice or order'. A warrant is not an order\\nserved on an accused; it is simply an order to the police to arrest him.3. It is not an\\noffence under this section to abscond to avoid arrest under a warrant.4.\\n[s 172.1] Bar to take Cognizance:\\nAs per section 195(1)(a)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, (Cr PC, 1973) No\\ncourt shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under S. 172 to 188 (both\\ninclusive) of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860, except on the complaint in writing of\\n'the public servant concerned' or of some other public servant to whom he is\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 663}),\n",

'To do or omit anything'.—It is not necessary that the public servant to whom false\\ninformation is given should be induced to do anything or to omit to do anything in\\nconsequence of such information. The gist of the offence is not what action may or\\nmay not be taken by the public servant to whom false information is given, but the\\nintention or knowledge (to be inferred from his conduct) of the person supplying such\\ninformation.73. Section 182 does not require that action must always be taken if the\\nperson who moves the public servant knows or believes that action would be taken.74.\\nUnder this clause it is not necessary to show that the act done would be to the injury or\\nannoyance of any third person.75.\\n[s 182.2] Condition precedent for prosecution.—\\nThis section has to be read in conjunction with section 195(1)(a) of the Cr PC, 1973\\nwhich requires a complaint for offences under sections 172–188, IPC, 1860, to be ﬁled\\nby the public servant concerned or by some other public servant to whom he is\\nadministratively subordinate.76.

The Bombay High Court has held that there are no\\nwords in the section as there are in section 99, extending the operation of the section\\nto acts which are not strictly justiﬁable by law. Resistance to an act of a public oﬃcer\\nacting bona ﬁde though in excess of his authority may give rise to some charge in the\\nnature of assault, but it cannot afford any foundation for a prosecution under this\\nsection.90. The Madras High Court is of opinion that this section should be read in\\nconjunction with section 99. Taking the two together, if an oﬃcer acts in good faith\\nunder colour of his oﬃce the mere circumstance that his \"act may not be strictly\\njustiﬁable by law\" cannot affect the lawfulness of his authority. In this case, property\\nhad been seized in execution by the oﬃcer of the Court, and it was held that as the\\noﬃcer was acting bona ﬁde, though he had wrongly seized the property of the accused,\\nthe accused could be convicted under this section for resisting the execution.91. This\\nview of the law receives substantial support from the decision of the Supreme Court in\\nKeshoram\\'s case92. where too it has been held that merely because no prior notice was\\nserved on the accused before seizing his cattle under the Delhi Municipal Act for\\nrecovering arrears of milk tax, it could not be said that the municipal oﬃcer\\'s action\\nwas entirely illegal and as such the accused had the right of private defence against\\nthe bona ﬁde act of the public servant. In the instant case the accused was held to have\\nbeen rightly convicted under sections 353/332/333, IPC, 1860, for assaulting the public\\nservant. On a parity of reasoning it can be said that had the accused been prosecuted\\nunder section 183 of the Code, he could have also been convicted under that section as\\nwell.\\n[s 183.1] Lawful authority wanted.—\\nWhere a person resisted an oﬃcial in attaching property under a warrant, the term of\\nwhich had already expired,93. or which did not specify the date on or before which it\\nwas to be executed,94. it was held that he was not guilty under this section.

Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].\\nCOMMENT—\\nThis section provides for voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his\\nduties. It must be shown that the obstruction or resistance was offered to a public\\nservant in the discharge of his duties or public functions as authorised by law. The\\nmere fact of a public servant believing that he was acting in the discharge of his duties\\nwill not be suﬃcient to make resistance or obstruction to him amount to an\\noffence.100. If the public servant is acting in good faith under colour of his oﬃce there\\nis no right of private defence against his act.101.\\nThe word \"obstruction\" connotes some overt act in the nature of violence or show of\\nviolence.102. To constitute \"obstruction\", it is not necessary that there should be actual\\ncriminal force. It is suﬃcient if there is either a show of force or a threat or any act\\npreventing the execution of any act by a public servant.103. Though an offence under\\nthis section is a non-cognizable one, by virtue of powers vested in the State\\nGovernment under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932, it can be\\nmade a cognizable offence in a speciﬁed area by means of a notiﬁcation, while such\\nnotiﬁcation remains in force.\\n[s 186.1] Initiation of Prosecution.—\\nTo initiate prosecution under this section it is necessary to see that the complaint is\\nﬁled under section 195(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973, by the concerned public servant or his\\nsuperior oﬃcer to whom he is administratively subordinate (See also discussion under\\nsub-head \"Condition precedent for Prosecution under section 182 ante.) It is also not\\npossible to bypass the requirements of section 195(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973, by merely\\nchanging the label of the offence, say from section 186 to section 353, IPC, 1860.104.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 694}),\n",

It is a well-\\naccepted proposition of law that when an accused commits some offences which are\\nseparate and distinct from those contained in section 195; section 195 will affect only\\nthe offences mentioned therein unless such other offences form an integral part of the\\nsame so as to amount to offences committed as a part of the same transaction. That\\nin such case the other offences would also fall within the ambit of section195 of the\\nCode. In other words, the offences charged against the petitioners under section143,\\n147, 148, 149, 332, 333 and 307 of IPC, 1860, cannot be split from the complaint for a\\nseparate offence in the facts and circumstances of the present case, and thereby\\ncognizance in respect to said offences are also barred under section 195(1)(a)(i) of the\\nCode.106.\\n[s 186.3] CASES.—Obstruction.—\\nA Circle Inspector went into the compound of the accused with a village servant to\\nremove a portion of the hedge which was an encroachment. When the servant put his\\nscythe to the hedge to cut it, the accused caught hold of the scythe and threatened\\nhim. It was held that the accused was guilty of an offence under this section, since his\\nlaying hold of the scythe amounted to physical obstruction, and the obstruction offered\\nto the servant was tantamount to obstruction to the Circle Inspector under whose\\norders he was acting.107. The daughter of the tenant of the accused died of\\nelectrocution. The police-oﬃcers entered the premises with permission to check fresh\\nwiring and leakage of current. They were prevented from taking photographs by the\\naccused and also not allowed to leave the house. The Court said that this amounted to\\nobstruction within the meaning of section 186 and wrongful conﬁnement within the\\nmeaning of section 342.108. Section 186 contemplates obstruction of a public servant\\nin the discharge of his public duty and section 332 contemplates voluntarily causing\\nhurt to him to deter him from performing his public duty. The gravity of the offences is\\ndifferent. Offence under section 332 is cognizable. The requirement of making a\\ncomplaint in writing as postulated by section 195, Cr PC, 1973, cannot be extended to\\nthe case of an offence under section 332.109.\\n[s 186.4] Section 186 and Section 353: Distinction between.—\\nSections 186 and 353, IPC, 1860 relate to two distinct offences and while the offence\\nunder the latter section is a cognizable offence the one under the former section is not\\nso. The ingredients of the two offences are also distinct. Section 186, IPC, 1860 is\\napplicable to a case where the accused voluntarily obstructs a public servant in the\\ndischarge of his public functions but under section 353, IPC, 1860 the ingredient of\\nassault or use of criminal force while the public servant is doing his duty as such is\\nnecessary. The quality of the two offences is also different. Section 186 occurs in\\nChapter X of the IPC, 1860 dealing with Contempts of the lawful authority of public\\nservants, while section 353 occurs in Chapter XVI regarding the Offences affecting the\\nhuman body.

What the section\\ndeals with are menaces which would have a tendency to induce the public servant to\\nalter his action. See section 503 which deﬁnes criminal intimidation and applies in all\\ncases. This section deals with criminal intimidation of a public servant. Threats of\\nviolence to a public servant who accepted bribe money but did not do the promised\\nwork are not covered by this section. A public servant deserves protection, since in the\\nperformance of his duties, he is likely to cause disappointment to many and invite their\\nwrath. That is why under sections 189 and 353 and various other sections of the IPC,\\n1860, a public servant is strongly protected and punishment for offences against him is\\nmade deterrent. However if a public servant has gone astray and indulged in\\nmalpractices, more especially by way of taking bribe, he would necessarily become\\nsubject to public criticism and private accountability. What appears then at the\\nforefront is not the performance of duty by the public servant, but the non-performance\\nof some contract dehors the normal functions of the public servant. If that illegal\\ncontract gives rise to any act of violence at any stage, such acts cannot constitute by\\nany stretch of imagination acts contemplated and punished under sections 353 and\\n189, IPC, 1860.128.\\nWhere workers of Communist Party (Marxist) went to a police station to protest\\nagainst the arrest of their party workers and in the process asked the police-oﬃcer to\\nrelease them on threat of dire consequences, it was held that the accused had\\ncommitted an offence under this section.129.

In relation to proceeding in any\\nCourt, the offences enumerated are: giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence\\n(sections 191–193); giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure\\nconviction (sections 194 and 195); threatening any person to give false evidence\\n(section 195A); using evidence known to be false (section 196); using as true a\\ncertiﬁcate known to be false (section 198); making a false statement in a declaration\\nwhich is by law receivable as evidence (section 199); using as true any declaration\\nreceivable as evidence, knowing it to be false (section 200); causing disappearance of\\nevidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender (section 201);\\nintentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform (section\\n202); giving false information in respect of an offence (section 203); destruction of\\ndocument or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence (section 204);\\nfalse personation (section 205); fraudulent removal/concealment of property (section\\n206); fraudulent claim to property (section 207); fraudulently suffering or obtaining\\ndecree for sum not due (section 208 and section 210); dishonestly making a false\\nclaim in Court (section 209); and intentional insult or interruption to public servant\\nsitting in judicial proceedings (section 228). Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure\\nprovides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section\\n172–188 (dealing with the contempt of the lawful authority of public servants) or\\nsection 193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and 228, when such offence is alleged to have\\nbeen committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the\\ncomplaint in writing of that Court by such oﬃcer of the Court as that Court may\\nauthorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that Court is\\nsubordinate.1.\\n[s 191] Giving false evidence.\\nWhoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the\\ntruth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject,1 makes any\\nstatement which is false,2. and which he either knows or believes to be false or does\\nnot believe to be true,3. is said to give false evidence.\\nE x p l a n a t i o n 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made\\nverbally or otherwise.\\nE x p l a n a t i o n 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the\\nmeaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by\\nstating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he\\nknows a thing which he does not know.\\nILLUSTRATIONS\\n(a)A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees,\\nfalsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the justice of B's claim.

'Legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law, etc.'— In case the\\nrecourse to a false plea is taken with an oblique motive, it would deﬁnitely hinder,\\nhamper or impede the ﬂow of justice and prevent the Courts from performing their\\nlegal duties.2 The Courts have to follow the procedures strictly and cannot allow a\\nwitness to escape the legal action for giving false evidence before the Court on mere\\nexplanation that he had given it under the pressure of the police or for some other\\nreason. Whenever the witness speaks falsehood in the Court, and it is proved\\nsatisfactorily, the Court should take a serious action against such witnesses.3 It is\\nnecessary that the accused should be legally bound by an oath before a competent\\nauthority. If the Court has no authority to administer an oath the proceeding will be\\ncoram non judice and a prosecution for false evidence will not stand.4. Similarly, if the\\nCourt is acting beyond its jurisdiction it will not be sustained.5. For the essentiality of\\nsection 191, petitioner must have been legally bound to speak truth or make a\\ndeclaration and he must have stated or declared what is false. He must also know or\\nbelieve what he has stated or declared is false or he has believed it true.

The information given by him is not on any oath nor was he bound to give\\nsuch information under any provision of Law.6.\\n[s 191.1] 'By an oath'.—\\nAn oath or a solemn aﬃrmation is not a sine qua non in the offence of giving false\\nevidence.7. The offence may be committed although the person giving evidence has\\nbeen either sworn or aﬃrmed.8. Whenever in a Court of law a person binds himself on\\noath to state the truth, he is bound to state the truth and he cannot be heard to say that\\nhe should not have gone into the witness box or should not have made an aﬃdavit. It is\\nno defence to say that he was not bound to enter the witness box.9.\\n[s 191.2] 'By an express provision of law'.—\\nUnder this clause sanction of an oath is not necessary; there must be a speciﬁc\\nprovision of law compelling a person to state the truth. Where the accused is not bound\\nby an express provision of law to state the truth he cannot be charged with giving false\\nevidence.10.\\n[s 191.3] 'Declaration upon any subject'.—\\nIn certain cases the law requires a declaration from a person of veriﬁcation in a\\npleading—and if such a declaration is made falsely it will come under this clause. The\\nwords 'any subject' denote that the declaration must be in connection with a subject\\nregarding which it was to be made.\\n2. 'Any statement which is false'.—It is not necessary that the false evidence should be\\nmaterial to the case in which it is given.11. If the statement made is designedly false,\\nthe accused is liable whether the statement had a material bearing or not upon the\\nmatter under enquiry before the Court.12.\\n3. 'Knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true'.—The matter sworn to\\nmust be either false in fact, or, if true, the accused must not have known it to be so. The\\nmaking of a false statement, without knowledge as to whether the subject-matter of\\nthe statement is false or not, is legally the giving of false evidence.13. Where a man\\nswears to a particular fact, without knowing at the time whether the fact be true or\\nfalse, it is as much perjury as if he knew the fact to be false, and equally indictable.14.\\nHowever, a man cannot be convicted of perjury for having acted rashly, or for having\\nfailed to make reasonable inquiry with regard to the facts alleged by him to be true.15.\\n[s 191.4] Two Contradictory Statements.—\\nMerely because a person makes two contradictory statements, one of which must be\\nfalse, it does not make out a case of perjury unless the falsity of one of the two\\nstatements as charged in the indictment is positively proved to be so.16. In India a\\nprosecution for perjury seems to be possible in such a case by virtue of illustration (e)\\nof section 221, The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it has been held to be\\ninexpedient to do so in the interest of justice. Thus, where a person made one\\nstatement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973 and a diametrically opposite statement in\\nCourt during the enquiry or trial, he could in view of this illustration be charged in the\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 707}),\n",

But to do so may be to tie\\nhim down to his previous false statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, and\\npreventing him from telling the truth even belatedly at the later stage of enquiry or trial.\\nThe Supreme Court too has felt that a witness whose statement has been recorded\\nunder section 164 Cr PC, 1973, feels tied to his previous statement and as such his\\nevidence has to be approached with caution.17. In the instant case as it could not be\\nshown that the earlier statements of the witnesses recorded under section 164 Cr PC,\\n1973 were true and those given before the Magistrate in course of the enquiry were\\nfalse, the complaints of perjury ﬁled against the witnesses were directed to be\\nwithdrawn.18.\\n[s 191.5] As to expert opinion.—\\nA scientiﬁc expert was asked to give his opinion regarding two cartridges, whether\\nthose were ﬁred from one ﬁrearm or from two different ones, without sending the\\nsuspected ﬁrearm to him. He gave opinion, inter alia, that no deﬁnite opinion could be\\noffered in order to link the ﬁrearm unless the ﬁrearm was made available to him. During\\nthe examination, the Court insisted him to give a deﬁnite opinion that too without\\nexamining the ﬁrearm. At that time, he opined that the cartridges appeared to have\\nbeen ﬁred from two separate ﬁrearms. Considering that there was a deliberate\\ndeviation in his opinion the High Court initiated proceedings against him under section\\n340 Cr PC, 1973 for perjury. The Supreme Court held that it is unjust, if not unfair, to\\nattribute any motive to the appellant that there was a somersault from his original\\nstand in the written opinion.19.\\n[s 191.6] Written statements and applications.—\\nA person ﬁling a written statement in a suit is bound by law to state the truth, and if he\\nmakes a statement which is false to his knowledge or belief, or which he believes not\\nbe to true, he is guilty of this offence.20. Signing and verifying an application for\\nexecution containing false statements is an offence under this section, and it makes no\\ndifference that at the time when the signature and veriﬁcation were appended the\\napplication was blank.21. But the veriﬁcation of an application, in which the applicant\\nmakes a false statement, does not subject him to punishment for this offence, if such\\napplication does not require veriﬁcation.22.\\n[s 191.7] Incriminating statement no justiﬁcation.—\\nWhen a party makes a false statement while legally bound by solemn aﬃrmation, the\\nfact that the statement was one tending to incriminate himself will not justify his\\nacquittal on a charge of giving false evidence.23.\\n[s 191.8] Illegality of trial does not purge perjury.—\\nThe fact that the trial in which false evidence is given is to be commenced de novo\\nowing to irregularity does not exonerate the person giving false evidence in that trial\\nfrom the obligation to speak the truth, and he is liable for giving false evidence.24.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 708}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 191.9] Prosecution for perjury.—\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that the courts should sanction the prosecution\\nfor perjury only in those cases where perjury appears to be deliberate and where it\\nwould be expedient in the interest of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely\\nbecause there is some inaccuracy in the statement.25.\\n[s 191.10] Accused not liable for giving false evidence.—\\nThe authors of the Code observe:\\nWe have no punishment for false evidence given by a person when on his trial for an\\noffence, though we conceive that such a person ought to be interrogated... If A stabs Z,\\nand afterwards on his trial denies that he stabbed Z, we do not propose to punish A as\\na giver of false evidence.26.\\nThe accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer questions\\nput by the Court or by giving false answers to them.27.\\n[s 191.11] CASES.—\\nIn a case, where the allegation was that the Attorney General and Chief Vigilance\\nOﬃcer gave consent to prosecute the Complainant without due care and without\\nproper application of mind. The Supreme Court held that it cannot be said that the\\ndocument conveying consent was a 'false document' or that giving of 'consent'\\namounted to giving of 'false evidence' or 'fabricating false evidence' at any stage of\\njudicial proceeding.28. A person could only be held guilty of an offence under section\\n191 if false evidence is knowingly given or when the statement is believed to be not\\ntrue.29. A witness falsely deposing in another's name;30. and a person falsely verifying\\nhis plaint;31. and an oﬃcial making a false return of the service of summons,32. were\\nheld guilty of giving false evidence. The Supreme Court has held that where a false\\naﬃdavit is sworn by a witness in a proceeding before a Court the offence would fall\\nunder this section and section 192. It is the offence of giving false evidence or of\\nfabricating false evidence for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding.33.\\nWhere a notice of perjury was issued to certain eye-witnesses but it could not be\\nshown with certainty that they were liars, it was held that the issue of notices was not\\nproper. The Court used its inherent powers and quashed the notices. The challenge\\nwas presented by only one of the witnesses on his own behalf as well as that of\\nothers.34.\\n[s 191.12] Aﬃdavit.—\\nAn aﬃdavit is evidence within the meaning of section 191 of the IPC, 1860. It was\\nalleged about an aﬃdavit ﬁled in a Court that it contained false statements. The\\naﬃdavit was ﬁled by the party suo motu and not under direction from the Court. Such\\nan aﬃdavit could not be termed as evidence. Hence, no action could be taken against\\nhim under the IPC, 1860.35. Process Server while he takes information from the\\nneighbours is not expected to get a sworn statement from them. It is neither an\\naﬃdavit nor a sworn statement. It is only an information, which he has collected to\\nshow his bona ﬁdes that he made attempts to serve the notice on the party.

Where C falsely represented himself to\\nbe U, and the writer of a document signed by U, and T, knowing that C was not U and\\nhad not written such document, adduced C as U, the writer of that document, it was\\nheld that T was guilty of abetment of giving false evidence.38.\\n[s 191.14] Bar under section 195 Cr PC, 1973.—\\nSection 195 of the Code lays down the procedure for prosecution for contempt of\\nlawful authority of public servants for offences against public justice and for offences\\nagainst public documents given in the form of evidence. As per this provision, Court is\\ndebarred from taking cognizance of any of the offences punishable under sections\\n193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and section 228, when such offence is alleged to have\\nbeen committed in, or in relation to, any proceedings in any Court except on the\\ncomplaint in writing of that Court by such oﬃcer of the Court as that Court may\\nauthorise in writing in that behalf or of some other Court to which that Court is\\nsubordinate. The term \"Court\" in the section means a Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court\\nand includes a tribunal. Section 340 of the Code prescribes the procedure to be\\nfollowed for offences mentioned in section 195 of the Code. Therefore, the summoning\\norders of the Magistrate against the petitioners under sections 193/191/209 IPC, 1860\\nare hit by provisions of section 195 of the Code and the cognizance taken by the\\nMagistrate of the offences is, therefore, without jurisdiction.39. Sections 191 and 192 of\\nthe IPC, 1860 are the sections that deﬁne offences for which punishment is provided\\nfor in sections 193 and 195 as mentioned in section 195(1)(b) (i), Criminal Procedure\\nCode. So the bar to initiate proceedings is applicable to sections 191 and 192 also.40.\\n[s 191.15] Procedure.—\\nA combined reading of the aforequoted provisions of Cr PC, 1973 and IPC, 1860 as\\nalso sub-section (3) of section 195, Cr PC, 1973 makes this legal position quite clear\\nthat they are applicable to any legal proceeding before a Civil Court or a Criminal Court,\\nincluding a Tribunal constituted by Central, Provincial or State Acts, if declared by that\\nparticular Act to be a Court for the purpose of section 195, Cr PC, 1973. Therefore, if\\nthe Family Court ﬁnds that any party to the proceeding or a witness therein has\\nintentionally given false evidence at any stage of a judicial proceeding or fabricated\\nfalse evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of the proceeding, and the\\nFamily Court is of the opinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an\\nenquiry should be made into any evidence referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of\\nsection 195, Cr PC, 1973 it may hold a preliminary enquiry and if it thinks necessary\\nthen it may record a ﬁnding to that effect and then proceed to make a complaint in\\nrespect of the particular offence/offences stipulated in clause (b) of section 195, Cr\\nPC, 1973 to the concerned Magistrate having jurisdiction against the said person.41.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 710}),\n",

A has fabricated false\\nevidence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nThe wording of this section is so general as to cover any species of crime, which\\nconsists in the endeavour to injure another by supplying false data upon which to rest a\\njudicial decision.\\n[s 192.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe offence deﬁned in this section has three ingredients:—\\n(1)Causing any circumstance to exist, or making any false entry in any book or\\nrecord, or making any document containing a false statement.\\n(2)Doing one of the above acts with the intention that it may appear in evidence in\\na judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant or\\nan arbitrator.\\n(3)Doing such act with the intention that it may cause any person, who in such\\nproceeding, is to form an opinion upon the evidence to entertain an erroneous\\nopinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding.43. From a\\ncareful reading of section 192, IPC, 1860, what transpires is that whoever forges\\na document, containing false statement or false entry, intending that such false\\nentry or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a\\nproceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, so appearing in\\nevidence, may cause any person, who, in such proceeding, is to form an opinion\\nupon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion in such proceeding, he is\\nsaid to fabricate false evidence.44.\\n1. 'Judicial proceeding'.—The Code of Criminal Procedure says that 'judicial\\nproceeding' includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be\\nlegally taken on oath [section 2(i)]. The power to take evidence on oath, which includes\\naﬃrmation as well,45. is the characteristic test of 'judicial proceeding'. 'Judicial\\nproceeding' means nothing more or less than a step taken by a Court in the course of\\nadministration of justice in connection with a case.46. Execution proceedings are\\njudicial proceedings.47.\\nIt is not essential that there should be any judicial proceeding pending at the time of\\nfabrication. It is enough that there is a reasonable prospect of such a proceeding\\nhaving regard to the circumstances of the case and that the document in question is\\nintended to be used in such a proceeding.48.\\n2. 'Public servant'.—The provisions of this section are not conﬁned to false evidence to\\nbe used in judicial proceedings, but to any proceeding before a public servant. A\\nGovernment correspondence was stealthily removed by accused No. 1 and handed\\nover to the pleader of accused Nos. 2 and 3. The correspondence was replaced by\\naccused No. 1. It was afterwards discovered that some papers had disappeared from\\nthe correspondence whilst others had been either mutilated or altered. It was held that\\naccused Nos. 2 and 3 were guilty of offences under sections 466 and 193.49.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 714}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"3. 'Material'.—The false evidence under this section should be material to the case in\\nwhich it is given though not so under section 191.50. The word 'material' means of such\\na nature as to affect in any way, directly or indirectly, the probability of anything to be\\ndetermined by the proceeding, or the credit of any witness, and a fact may be material\\nalthough evidence of its existence was improperly admitted.51.\\n4. 'Fabricate'.—The term fabrication refers to the fabrication of false evidence; and if\\nthe evidence fabricated is intended to be used in a judicial proceeding, the offence is\\ncommitted as soon as the fabrication is complete; it is immaterial that the judicial\\nproceeding has not been commenced,52. or that no actual use has been made of the\\nevidence fabricated. The mere fabrication is punishable under section 193; the use of\\nthe fabricated evidence is punishable under section 196.\\nThe evidence fabricated must be admissible evidence.53.\\n[s 192.2] Liability of accused for fabricating false evidence.—\\nIt has been held by the High Courts of Calcutta54. and Bombay55. that an offender who\\nfabricates false evidence to screen himself from punishment is liable to be convicted\\nunder this section. The Allahabad High Court56. has veered round to the same view,\\nafter distinguishing an earlier case57. to the contrary.\\n[s 192.3] Vicarious liability.—\\nNeither section 192 IPC, 1860 nor section 199 IPC, 1860, incorporate the principle of\\nvicarious liability, and therefore, it was incumbent on the complainant to speciﬁcally\\naver the role of each of the accused in the complaint.58. Penal Code does not contain\\nany provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the managing Director or the\\nDirector for the Company when the accused is the company. Vicarious liability arise\\nprovided any provision exits in that behalf in the statute. It is obligatory on the part of\\nthe complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provision\\nconstituting vicarious liability.59.\\n[s 192.4] CASES.—Fabrication of evidence to be used in judicial proceeding.—\\nThe brother of an accused person applied to the Court on behalf of the accused asking\\nthat the witnesses for the prosecution might ﬁrst be made to identify the accused. The\\nCourt assenting to this request, he produced before the Court ten or twelve men, none\\nof whom could be identiﬁed as the accused by any of the witnesses. Upon being asked\\nby the Court where the accused was, he pointed out a man who was not the accused. It\\nwas held that he was guilty of fabricating false evidence.60. The accused, who was in\\npossession of the complainant's house as a yearly tenant, about the time the tenancy\\ncame to an end, prepared another rent-note for a period of four years and got it\\nregistered without the complainant's knowledge. It was held that the accused had\\nfabricated false evidence inasmuch as the rent-note, which contained an admission\\nagainst the interest of the accused, could be admitted in evidence on his behalf.61. By\\nswearing a false aﬃdavit the accused makes himself prima facie liable under section\\n193 read with sections 191 and 192 of the IPC, 1860.62.

Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure\\nprovides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section\\n172–188 (dealing with the contempt of the lawful authority of public servants) or\\nsection 193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and 228, when such offence is alleged to have\\nbeen committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the\\ncomplaint in writing of that Court by such oﬃcer of the Court as that Court may\\nauthorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that Court is\\nsubordinate.1.\\n[s 193] Punishment for false evidence.\\nWhoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or\\nfabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial\\nproceeding,1 shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term\\nwhich may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to ﬁne, and whoever\\nintentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case,2 shall be punished\\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years,\\nand shall also be liable to ﬁne.\\nE x p l a n a t i o n 1.—A trial before a Court-martial; 67.

A has given false evidence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nSections 191 and 192 deﬁne the offences punishable under this section. The ﬁrst\\nparagraph applies only to cases in which the false evidence is given in a judicial\\nproceeding, the second to all other cases. If the offence is committed in any stage of a\\njudicial proceeding it is more severely punishable than when it is committed in a non-\\njudicial proceeding.\\nIntention is the essential ingredient in the constitution of this offence. If the statement\\nwas false, and known or believed by the accused to be false, it may be presumed that\\nin making that statement he intentionally gave false evidence. In order to make a\\nperson liable for perjury it is necessary that he should have made a statement on oath\\nregarding the facts on which his statement was based and then deny those facts on\\noath on a subsequent occasion.68. The mere fact that a deponent has made\\ncontradictory statements at two different stages in a judicial proceeding is not by itself\\nalways suﬃcient to justify a prosecution for perjury under section 193 but it must be\\nestablished that the deponent has intentionally given false statement in any stage of\\nthe 'judicial proceeding' or fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in\\nany stage of the 'judicial proceeding'.69.\\nIt is not necessary that the false statement should be material to the case. The gist of\\nthe offence is the giving or fabrication of false evidence intentionally. Where knowledge\\nof falsity is proved, intention is readily presumed.70.\\n1. 'Any stage of a judicial proceeding'.—The recording of a statement under section\\n161 itself is a judicial proceeding in view of Explanation 2 to section 193 in so far as\\nrecording of a statement is part of the investigation directed by law preliminary to a\\nproceeding before a Court of justice and therefore is a stage of the judicial\\nproceedings. Mere failure to support contention made in said FIR while giving evidence\\nunder section 164 Cr PC, 1973, can't conclusively lead to hold that he had given false\\nevidence by departing from contentions made in FIR.71. Where a witness in Sessions\\ntrial deposing contrary to what he had said in a statement recorded under section 164,\\nrecourse to section 340 cannot be taken without ﬁrst deciding whether the earlier\\nstatement was false.72. In the course of proceedings for execution of a decree in a\\nCourt which had no jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings the judgment-debtor\\nmade a false statement and produced a forged receipt. The Court made a complaint\\nunder section 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code for prosecution of the judgment-\\ndebtor in respect of the said offences; it was held that if during the course of the\\nproceedings which were ultra vires and illegal any offence under section 471 of the\\nCode was committed, it could not be said that it was committed in or in relation to, or\\nby a party to, any judicial proceedings, in which evidence could be legally taken, and\\ntherefore the complaint must be dismissed.73.

Giving\\nfalse evidence in support of the prosecution case during the course of trial falls within\\nthe ambit of sections 193 and 195, IPC, 1860, and not under section 211, IPC, 1860, as\\nthere is no institution of criminal proceeding in such a case.75. (See Comments under\\nsub-head \"Falsely Charges\" under section 211 infra.) Where the accused abetted the\\noffence of forgery by creating a false document with a view to use it in a suit but did\\nnot use it in the suit, it was held that there was no question of prosecuting him under\\nsection 193, IPC, 1860, nor was a Court complaint under section 195(1) (b) (i), Cr PC,\\n1973, necessary in the case. The accused could be safely prosecuted under section\\n467 read with section 114, IPC, 1860, on a private complaint.76.\\nWhere the accused police-oﬃcer asked a police oﬃcial to forge the signature of his\\nsuperior on the carbon copy of the counter-aﬃdavit containing false averments and the\\nsame was ﬁled in the Supreme Court with that forged signature, the accused was held\\nguilty of an offence under section 192.77.\\nQuestions which a person is compelled to answer and the answers which have a\\ntendency to incriminate, cannot be the sole basis of a charge of perjury.78.\\n[s 193.1] Court Complaint: When?—\\nIn Iqbal Singh Marwah v Meenakshi Marwah,79. the Constitution Bench held that the\\nsection 195(1)(b)(ii) -Cr PC, 1973 which mandates that \\'no Court shall take cognizance\\nof offences relating to documents given in evidence except on the complaint in writing\\nof that Court, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate\\', would be\\nattracted only when the offences enumerated in the said provision have been\\ncommitted with respect to a document after it has been produced or given in evidence\\nin a proceedings in any Court, i.e., during the time when the documents was in c u s t o d i a l\\nl e g i s.80. Though the Rent Controller discharges quasi-judicial functions, he is not a\\nCourt, as understood in the conventional sense and he cannot, therefore, make a\\ncomplaint under section 340 Cr PC, 1973.81.\\n[s 193.2] Belated complaint.—\\nA witness made false statement before a competent Court and the accused were\\nconvicted. The appellate Court (Sessions Court) held that the witness had given false\\nstatement and directed that a notice be issued to him to show cause why a complaint\\nunder section 193, IPC, 1860 be not ﬁled against him. The notice was issued and after\\nhearing him, the Court directed that a complaint be ﬁled. The High Court found that the\\nnotice issued to him was no notice because it did not specify the portions that were\\nfound to be false, besides the statement was recorded ten years ago.

It was held by the three\\nJudge Bench that the Supreme Court could not try and convict the accused. The order\\nof the Supreme Court convicting the accused and sentencing him to three months\\'\\nimprisonment was liable to be set aside because of non-compliance of procedure\\nprescribed by sections 195 and 340, Cr PC, 1973 and also because of lack of original\\njurisdiction to try a criminal offence under section 193, IPC, 1860.

The due process of\\nlaw cannot be permitted to be slighted nor the majesty of law be made a mockery by\\nsuch acts or conduct on the part of the parties to the litigation or even while appearing\\nas witnesses. Anyone who makes an attempt to impede or undermine or obstruct the\\nfree ﬂow of the unsoiled stream of justice by resorting to the ﬁling of false evidence\\ncommits criminal contempt of the Court and renders himself liable to be dealt with in\\naccordance with the Act.

The Court directed that a complaint under sections 193, 196 and\\n199 be lodged against the respondent.85.

Subsequently they ﬁled aﬃdavits stating that they were\\nthreatened by higher oﬃcers not to support their previous statements during\\ninvestigation. Court set aside the order of acquittal of the accused, ordered re-trial and\\ndirected to proceed under sections 193 and 195A.87. After a long span of time, the\\nprosecution witnesses ﬁled a false aﬃdavit stating that they were coerced and tutored\\nby police. They were held liable for perjury.88.\\n2. 'In any other case'.—A statement made in the course of a public investigation under\\nsection 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure comes within these words.89. Whether\\nthe accused has really made a false statement or not is a question of fact, which can\\nbe decided at the trial and not in quashing proceeding, when the allegations, which\\nhave been made against the accused do make out a prima facie case under section\\n193, IPC, 1860.90.

It is held that offence punishable\\nunder section 193 of IPC, 1860 is not made out.91.\\n[s 193.7] Section 193 IPC, 1860 and Section 125A of the Representation of\\nPeoples Act, 1950.—\\nWhere a speciﬁc penal provision is made under the Act providing a penalty for ﬁling\\nfalse aﬃdavit under section 125A of the Act, without anything more, for ﬁling such a\\nfalse aﬃdavit, that alone, no prosecution under the general penal provision of section\\n193 of the Penal Code is entertainable. Furthermore, the penal provision under section\\n193 IPC, 1860 has to be understood giving signiﬁcance to the expressions 'intentionally\\ngiving or fabricating false evidence', 'in any stage of a judicial proceeding' or 'in any\\nother case.' Giving or fabricating false evidence in the aforesaid section whether it be in\\nthe judicial proceeding or in any other case must have been intended to form an\\nopinion on the evidence erroneously and such forming of opinion should be touching\\nthe point material to the result of such proceeding. Viewed in that angle the declaration\\nto be made by a candidate in his aﬃdavit ﬁled with his nomination paper over the\\nmatters prescribed by the election commission when he contests an election, it cannot\\nbe stated that the candidate is giving evidence by aﬃdavit but at best only a\\ndeclaration on the particulars sought for. If the candidate fails to furnish information or\\ngives false information which he knows or has reason to believe to be false or conceals\\nany information he is liable to be prosecuted only for the offence under section 125A of\\nthe Act, and not for the penal offence under section 193 IPC, 1860.92.\\n[s 193.8] Section 193 IPC, 1860 and proceedings under section 340 Cr PC,\\n1973.—\\nPower to punish under section 344 Cr PC, 1973 and section 193 Cr PC, 1973 are\\ndistinct. Section 344 Cr PC, 1973 calls for summary trial, whereas under section 193\\nIPC, 1860 offender is to be tried as warrant case. Section 344 Cr PC, 1973 vests powers\\nin the Courts to summarily try and punish the accused. It is for this reason that section\\n344 Cr PC, 1973 prescribes sentence also. The Judge either should have convicted the\\npetitioner under section 344 Cr PC, 1973 or ought not to have invoked section 193 IPC,\\n1860. Once, the Judge opted to try the petitioner for the offence under section 193 IPC,\\n1860, it was incumbent upon him to hold an inquiry under section 340 Cr PC, 1973 and\\nthen to frame a charge and try the offender for a warrant case as minimum sentence\\nprescribed under section 193 IPC, 1860 is three years.93.

A is liable to imprisonment of either description for\\nseven years, and also to ﬁne.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nObject.—This section relates to the disappearance of any evidence of the commission\\nof an offence and includes also the giving of false information with the intention of\\nscreening an offender. Sections 202 and 203 relate to the giving or omitting to give\\nsuch information, and section 204 to the destruction of documentary evidence.\\nThere are three groups of sections in the Code relating to the giving of information.\\nFirst, sections 118–120 deal with concealment of a design to commit an offence;\\nsecond sections 176, 177, 181 and 182 deal with omission to give information and with\\nthe giving of false information; and, third, sections 201–203 deal with causing the\\ndisappearance of evidence.\\n[s 201.1] Scope.—\\nThe Supreme Court has held that this section is not restricted to the case of a person\\nwho screens the actual offender; it can be applied even to a person guilty of the main\\noffence, though as a matter of practice a Court will not convict a person both of the\\nmain offence and under this section.133.\\nBut, if the commission of the main offence is not brought home to the accused, then he\\ncan be convicted under this section.134. Where it is impossible to say deﬁnitely that a\\nperson has committed the principal offence he cannot escape conviction under this\\nsection merely because there are grounds for suspicion that he might be the principal\\nculprit.135. A woman's husband and in-laws could not be convicted of murdering her\\nbecause there was no evidence whatsoever. They were convicted under this section\\nbecause they gave no reasonable explanation of the unnatural death and had also\\ndisposed of the body in suspicious circumstances (dead body found near railway\\ntrack).136. The fact that the accused persons cannot be convicted for offence\\npunishable under section 302 IPC, 1860 does not extricate them from the offence\\nunder section 201 IPC, 1860.137. In a case of bride burning, where the post-mortem\\nreport was that death was due to throttling, burning her subsequently was held to be a\\nclear proof of the fact that the evidence of strangulation was sought to be destroyed by\\nthe accused husband by pouring kerosene and setting her ablaze. The conviction of the\\nhusband under sections 201, 302 and 498-A was held to be proper.138.\\nA statement given by a person in the course of an investigation by the police cannot\\namount to an offence under this section and section 203, even if it ultimately turns out\\nto be false.139. The allegation against the appellant was that, he had deliberately\\nshielded the real offenders in the murder case and was accordingly liable for the\\noffence under section 201 of the IPC, 1860. Supreme Court acquitted the accused\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 744}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='holding that it is not possible on the evidence to ascertain, as to whether the appellant\\nwas, in fact, guilty of the offence alleged against him.140.\\nThe Supreme Court has held that where the evidence showed that a person had died\\nand his body was found in a trunk and discovered in a well, and that the accused had\\ntaken part in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of\\nhis death, or the manner or circumstances in which it came about, it was held that the\\naccused could not be convicted for an offence under this section.141. In other words,\\nthe mere secreting of a dead body without ﬁrst proving that the corpse secreted was\\nthe corpus delicti of a murder case is no offence under section 201, IPC, 1860.142.\\n[s 201.2] Independent offence.—\\nA charge under section 201 of the IPC, 1860 can be independently laid and conviction\\nmaintained also, in case the prosecution is able to establish that an offence had been\\ncommitted, the person charged with the offence had the knowledge or the reason to\\nbelieve that the offence had been committed, the said person has caused\\ndisappearance of evidence and such act of disappearance has been done with the\\nintention of screening the offender from legal punishment. Mere suspicion is not\\nsuﬃcient, it must be proved that the accused knew or had a reason to believe that the\\noffence has been committed and yet he caused the evidence to disappear so as to\\nscreen the offender. The offender may be either himself or any other person.143. It has\\nbeen held that the offence under the section is of independent nature, though it cannot\\nbe separated from the substance of the main offence. Accordingly, a conviction under\\nthe section can be recorded even though the commission of the main offence is not\\nestablished. The Court, however, pointed out that such cases are likely to be very small\\nin number. Applying this to the facts of the case, the Court held that the accused was\\nguilty of offence under this section because he had buried the dead body of his wife in\\nhis ﬁeld and misguided the police of her disappearance, though, because of\\ndecomposition, it could not be proved that he was responsible for her death.144.\\n[s 201.3] Ingredients.—\\nTo bring home a charge under section 201, IPC, the prosecution must prove:—\\n(1)That an offence has been committed.\\n(2)That the accused knew or had reason to believe the commission of such an\\noffence.\\n(3)That with such knowledge or belief he\\n(a)caused any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear, or\\n(b)gave any information relating to that offence which he then knew or\\nbelieved to be false.\\n(4)That he did so as aforesaid with the intention of screening the offender from\\nlegal punishment.\\n(5)If the charge be of an aggravated form, it must be further proved that the\\noffence in respect of which the accused did as in (3) and (4) supra, was\\npunishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment extending to ten\\nyears.145.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 745}),\n",

'Knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed'.—It must\\nbe proved that an offence, the evidence of which the accused is charged with causing\\nto disappear, has actually been committed,146. and that the accused knew, or had\\ninformation suﬃcient to lead him to believe, that the offence had been committed.147.\\nUnless the prosecution was able to establish that the accused person knew or had\\nreason to believe that an offence has been committed and had done something\\ncausing the offence of commission of evidence to disappear, he cannot be\\nconvicted.148.\\nWhere the accused committed rape on a seven-year-old minor girl at his studio, killed\\nher and disposed of her dead body in a carton. The dead body of the deceased was\\nfound in the carton, which the accused procured from witness. Conviction under\\nsections 302, 376 and 201 IPC, 1860 is maintained.149.\\nThe charge framed was for causing disappearance for evidence. The fact that\\nconcealment was the likely effect of the Act is not enough. There was no evidence to\\nattribute the knowledge of the death of the victim woman to the accused. Hence, the\\nessential ingredient of the offence was missing.150.\\n[s 201.4] Causing disappearance by preventing information from reaching\\npolice.—\\nWhere after raping a girl of 11 years the accused persons thrust a stick into her private\\npart of which she died and they falsely told the mother of the victim that they had\\nalready reported the matter to the police and in the meantime there was disappearance\\nof evidence, they were held liable under this section.151. Where the Court has no case\\nthat there is any intentional omission to give information by the accused to the police,\\nthe conviction under section 201 cannot be maintained only on the ground that no\\ncommunication was given to the police and that the post-mortem had not been\\nperformed. It is also no case of the complainant that he had requested for post-\\nmortem of the body and that intimation should have been given to the police before the\\nlast rites were performed and there is also no charge under section 202 of the IPC,\\n1860 of intentionally omitting to give information of the unnatural death to the\\npolice.152.\\n2. 'Intention of screening offence of offender'.—The intention to screen the offender\\nmust be the primary and sole object of the accused. The fact that the concealment was\\nlikely to have that effect is not suﬃcient.153. The accused person killed his brother and\\nhis whole family in order to avoid partition of the joint family property. There was no\\nevidence to show that his son had common intention with him or participated in the\\ncommission of the crime. But because he had seen his father commit multiple\\nmurders, he tried to destroy the evidence by throwing away certain articles on two\\noccasions from over a bridge. It seemed obvious that he had done that with the\\nprimary object of saving his father. He was convicted under this section.154.\\nWhere a man shot down his wife with his pistol, his companion, who played no other\\nrole, but concealed the authorship of the homicide, he was held guilty under this\\nsection.155. Where the co-accused persons told the investigating oﬃcer that the\\ndeceased was not present in the house at the material time, it was held that this\\namounted to the offence of screening the offender.156.\\n[s 201.5] Cases.—\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 746}),\n",

In another case where the accused\\ncommitted murder of his wife assaulting on her head with a chopper did cause the\\nevidence to disappear by setting ﬁre to the dead body after pouring kerosene on her, it\\nis found that the accused has committed an offence punishable under sections 302\\nand 201 of IPC, 1860.158. Where unnatural conduct of appellants to dispose of dead\\nbody of victim without having awaited for victim's husband who was already on his way\\nto home and the evidence shows that victim died under unnatural circumstances,\\nconviction under sections 302 and 201 IPC, 1860 is upheld.159. Where the accused\\nhusband strangulated his young wife to death and attempted to destroy evidence by\\nburning her dead body, the order of acquittal of the accused of the offence under\\nsections 300 and 201 was reversed by the Apex Court.160.\\n[s 201.6] Help rendered to conceal crime.—\\nWhere a person through fear did not interpose to prevent the commission of a murder,\\nand afterwards helped the murderers in concealing the body, it was held that he was\\nnot guilty of abetment of murder but was guilty of an offence under this section.161. A\\nperson who assists the actual murderers in removing the corpse of their victim to a\\ndistance from the place where the murder was committed is prima facie guilty of an\\noffence under this section, until he can establish that he acted under compulsion.162.\\nWhere it appeared from the statement of the accused that he took from the men who,\\naccording to him committed the murder, a jewel which was unquestionably the\\nproperty of the deceased and he hid it and produced it later, it was held that the\\naccused, when he hid the jewel, had the intention of screening the offender, whoever he\\nwas, from legal punishment and so was guilty of an offence under this section.163. The\\ndeath of a woman was caused on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the house and her mother-in-law, the\\nonly other occupant of the house at the time of the occurrence, was residing on the\\nground ﬂoor. The place of incident was intermeddled and bamboo pieces, rafters, and\\nbroken tiles were thrown over the dead body with a view to cause disappearance of\\nevidence and to screen the offender. It was held that it was not possible without the\\ncomplicity of the mother-in-law and hence though she could not be held guilty of\\nmurder or abetting it, she was guilty of an offence under section 201.164.\\n[s 201.7] Death in custody.—\\nWhere there was death of a person in the police custody while he was detained there\\nfor interrogation and his dead body was not traced, however, the evidence of other\\nwitnesses who were also beaten up and injured by the police, categorically established\\nthat the deceased became unconscious on receipt of injuries inﬂicted by the police and\\ndied, it was held that an irresistible inference could be drawn that the police personnel\\nwho caused the death, must also have caused the disappearance of the body.165.\\n[s 201.8] Bride burning.—\\nIn a bride burning case, the victim was murdered and thereafter her body was burnt to\\nscreen the offence.

In appeal, High Court acquitted her of the charge\\nof murder, but convicted under section 201 of Penal Code. In the appeal before\\nSupreme Court, it was held that in order to establish the charge under section 201 IPC,\\n1860 it is essential to prove that substantive offence has been committed and the\\naccused knew or had reason to believe that such offence has been committed with\\nrequisite knowledge and intention of screening the offender from such legal\\npunishment, caused any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear or\\ngave any information respecting such offence or having such knowledge or believed to\\nbe false.

Where the members of an unlawful assembly\\nindiscriminately killed ﬁve persons, dragged the dead bodies over a distance, beheaded\\nthe victims and threw their limbs and bodies in the raging ﬁre, they not only committed\\nan offence under section 201, IPC, 1860, but were also liable under sections 302/149,\\nIPC, 1860.179.

       " Document(page_content='(2)Preferring a false charge against a person.\\nThe ﬁrst assumes the second, but the second may be committed where no criminal\\nproceedings follow.\\nThe necessary ingredients to constitute either of the above offences are—\\n(1)the criminal proceedings must be instituted, or the false charge made with\\nintent to injure;\\n(2)the criminal proceedings must be instituted, or the false charge must be made,\\nwithout just or lawful ground, in other words, it must be made maliciously.\\nDifference is made in punishment according as the charge relates to offences\\npunishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or otherwise.\\nThe mere making of a false charge is punishable under the ﬁrst part of the section. If a\\ncase gets no further than a police inquiry, it falls within that part. But under the second\\npart there should be an actual institution of criminal proceedings on a false charge.225.\\nTwo conditions are necessary before the enhanced punishment provided in the second\\nparagraph could be inﬂicted: (1) proceedings on the false charge should have been\\nactually instituted, and (2) the false charge must be in respect of an offence punishable\\nwith death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards.\\n[s 211.1] Sections 182 and 211.—\\nAccording to the Bombay High Court there is a clear distinction between a false charge\\nthat falls under section 211 and false information given to the police, in which latter\\ncase the offence falls under section 182. A person prosecuting another under section\\n182 need not prove malice and want of reasonable and probable cause except so far\\nas they are implied in the act of giving information known to be false, with the\\nknowledge or likelihood that such information would lead a public servant to use his\\npower to the injury or annoyance of the complainant. In an inquiry under section 211,\\non the other hand, proof of the absence of just and lawful ground for making the\\ncharge is an important element.226. If the information conveyed to the police amounts\\nto the institution of criminal proceedings against a deﬁned person or amounts to the\\nfalsely charging of a deﬁned person with an offence, then the person giving such\\ninformation is guilty of an offence under section 211. In such a case, section 211 is,\\nand section 182 is not, the appropriate section under which to frame a charge. Section\\n182, when read with section 211, must be understood as referring to cases where the\\ninformation given to the public servant falls short of amounting to institution of\\ncriminal proceedings against a deﬁned person and falls short of amounting to the\\nfalsely charging of a deﬁned person with an offence as deﬁned in the Penal Code.227.\\nThe Calcutta, the Madras, the Allahabad and the Patna High Courts differ from this\\nview of the Bombay High Court. The Calcutta High Court has ruled that a prosecution\\nfor a false charge may be under section 182 or section 211, but if the false charge was\\na serious one, the graver section 211 should be applied and the trial should be full and\\nfair.228. Where a false charge is made to the police of a cognizable offence the offence\\ncommitted by the person making the charge falls within the meaning of section 211\\nand not section 182.229.\\nThe Madras High Court has held that there is no error in a conviction under section 182,\\nwhen the false charge made before the police was punishable under the ﬁnal clause of\\nsection 211. The High Court may quash the conviction and sentence for the minor\\noffence and direct a trial before a tribunal having jurisdiction for the graver offence.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 774}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Whether it will do so, or not, is a question, not of law, but of expediency on the facts of\\nthe particular case.230.\\nThe Allahabad High Court had held that where a speciﬁc false charge is made, the\\nproper section, for proceedings to be adopted under section 211.231. Although it is\\ndiﬃcult to see what case would arise under section 211 to which section 182 could not\\nbe applied yet section 182 would apply to a case that might not fall under section 211.\\nThe offence under section 182 is complete when false information is given to a public\\nservant by a person who believes it to be false, but who intends thereby to cause such\\npublic servant to institute criminal proceedings against a third person. The offence is\\ncomplete although the public servant takes no steps towards the institution of such\\ncriminal proceedings. There is no restriction imposed by the Penal Code or by the\\nCriminal Procedure Code upon the prosecution of an offence either under section 182\\nor section 211. It appears that it has been left to the discretion of the Court to\\ndetermine when and under what circumstances prosecution should be proceeded with\\nunder sections 182 and 211.232. The soundness of this view is doubted in subsequent\\ncases.233.\\nThe Patna High Court has followed the view of the Calcutta High Court.234.\\nThe Lahore High Court has held that an offence under section 182 is included in the\\nmore serious offence under section 211 and a prosecution for a false charge may be\\neither under section 182 or section 211, though clearly if section 211 does apply and\\nthe false charge is serious, the prosecution should be under section 211.235.\\n1. \\'Intent to cause injury\\'.—This is an essential part of the offence.236.\\n2. \\'Institutes or causes to be instituted any criminal proceedings\\'.—The word\\n\"proceedings\" is used in this section in the ordinary sense of a prescribed mode of\\naction for prosecuting a right or redressing a wrong. It is not used in the technical\\nsense of a proceeding taken in a Court of law.237. Neither the proceedings before the\\nDisciplinary Committee of the Bar Council of India, is a criminal proceeding nor was the\\ncharge in the Disciplinary Proceedings in relation to an offence. Charge in the\\nDisciplinary Proceedings before the Bar Council of India is only in respect of\\nprofessional misconduct and not offence as such.238. Under this section \\'instituting a\\ncriminal proceeding\\' may be treated as an offence in itself apart from \\'falsely charging\\'\\na person with having committed an offence. There are two modes in which a person\\naggrieved may seek to put the criminal law in motion: (1) by giving information to the\\npolice (Criminal Procedure Code, section 154) and (2) by lodging a complaint before a\\nMagistrate (Criminal Procedure Code, sections 190, 200). A person who sets the\\ncriminal law in motion by making to the police a false charge in respect of a cognizable\\noffence institutes criminal proceedings.239. But as the police have no power to take any\\nproceedings in non-cognizable cases without orders from a Magistrate, a false charge\\nof such offence, made to the police, is not an institution of criminal proceedings, but\\nmerely a false charge.240. The distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable\\noffences relates to the powers of the police only, and it will, therefore, seem that the\\nfalse charge of any offence, whether cognizable or non-cognizable, before a Magistrate\\nis an institution of criminal proceedings.\\n3. \\'Falsely charges\\'.—The word \\'charges\\' means something different from \\'gives\\ninformation\\'. The true test seems to be, does the person who makes the statement that\\nis alleged to constitute the \\'charge\\' do so with the intention and object of setting the\\ncriminal law in motion against the person against whom the statement is directed?\\nSuch object and intention may be inferred from the language of the statement and the\\ncircumstances in which it is made.241. The false charge must be made to a Court, or to\\nan oﬃcer who has power to investigate and send it up for trial.242.

It is enough that a false charge is made though no prosecution\\nis instituted thereon.245. Where a person who gives false information as to the\\ncommission of an offence merely states that he suspected a certain other person to be\\nthe offender, it may be that he would not be liable under this section, but where it is\\nclear that the informant\\'s intention was not merely that the police should follow up a\\nclue but that they should put the alleged offender on trial, the informant is guilty of an\\noffence under this section.246. The Calcutta High Court has held that the meaning of\\nthe expression \\'falsely charges\\' is simply \\'falsely accuses\\' and as the section stands\\nthere is no necessity of this false accusation being made in connection with a criminal\\nproceeding.247.\\n[s 211.2] Giving false Evidence: No false charge.—\\nThe words \"falsely charges\" in this section cannot mean giving false evidence against\\nthe accused as a prosecution witness during the course of a trial. To \"falsely charge\"\\nmust refer to the criminal or initial accusation putting or seeking to put in motion the\\nmachinery of criminal investigation and not when seeking to prove the false charge by\\nmaking deposition in support of the charge framed in that trial. The words \"falsely\\ncharges\" have to be read along with the expression \"institution of criminal\\nproceedings\". The false charge must, therefore, be made initially to a person in\\nauthority or to someone who is in a position to get the offender punished by\\nappropriate proceedings. In other words it must be embodied either in a complaint or in\\na report of a cognizable offence to the police-oﬃcer or to an oﬃcer having authority\\nover the person against whom the allegations are made. Giving false evidence in\\ncourse of a trial amounts to an offence under sections 193 and 195 and not under\\nsection 211, IPC, 1860.248.\\n[s 211.3] Bare statement is not false charge.—\\nA statement to the police of a suspicion that a particular person has committed an\\noffence is not a charge within the meaning of this section, nor does it amount to\\ninstitution of criminal proceedings; and a conviction cannot be had on proof that the\\nsuspicion was unfounded.249. The accused made a report to the police that his buffalo\\nhad been poisoned and that he suspected two persons whom he named of having\\nadministered the poison. The police made an inquiry and reported that there was no\\ncase of poisoning and the charge was struck off. One of the persons then brought a\\ncomplaint under this section against the accused. It was held that the report to the\\npolice did not amount to a charge of a criminal offence.250.\\n[s 211.4] Statement under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code.—\\nA statement under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, in answer to questions put by\\na police-oﬃcer making an investigation under section 161 of the Code, cannot be made', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 776}),\n",

False identiﬁcation in a Test\\nIdentiﬁcation Parade is not falsely charging.252.\\n4. \\'Knowing that there is no just or lawful ground\\'.—This expression is the equivalent of\\nthe English technical phrase \"without reasonable or probable cause,\" which means an\\nhonest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon\\nreasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming\\nthem to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed\\nin the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably\\nguilty of the crime imputed. There must be:\\nFirst, an honest belief of the accuser in the guilt of the accused;\\nSecond, such belief must be based on an honest conviction of the existence of the\\ncircumstances which led the accuser to that conclusion;\\nThird, such belief must be based upon reasonable grounds; that is, such grounds as\\nwould lead any fairly cautious man in the defendant\\'s situation so to believe;\\nFourth, the circumstances so believed and relied on by the accuser must be such as\\namount to reasonable ground for belief in the guilt of the accused.253.\\nA person may, in good faith, institute a charge that is subsequently found to be false, or\\nhe may, with intent to cause injury to an enemy, institute criminal proceedings against\\nhim, believing there are good grounds for them but in neither case has he committed\\nan offence under this section. To constitute this offence it must be shown that the\\nperson instituting criminal proceedings knew there was no just or lawful ground for\\nsuch proceedings.254.\\nIn the absence of any special circumstances to rebut it, the judgment of one competent\\ntribunal against the complainant affords very strong evidence of reasonable and\\nprobable cause.255.\\n5. \\'If such criminal proceeding be instituted\\'.—There is a divergence of views between\\nthe Calcutta, the Madras and the Patna High Courts on the one hand, and the Allahabad\\nand the Lahore High Courts on the other, on the question whether the latter part of the\\nsection applies to such cases of complaints to the police which are disposed of\\nwithout a formal magisterial inquiry. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court has held\\nthat the latter part would apply to such cases where the charge related to the more\\nserious offence.256. This case is followed by the Madras257. and the Patna258. High\\nCourts. The test to apply is,—did the person who made the charge intend to set the\\ncriminal law in motion against the person on whom the charge is made.259.\\nThe Allahabad High Court has, on the other hand, held that to constitute the offence\\ndeﬁned in the second paragraph of this section, it is necessary that criminal\\nproceedings should be instituted. Where the offence committed does not go further\\nthan the making of a false charge to the police, the making of such charge does not\\namount to institution of criminal proceedings, and the offence committed will fall\\nwithin the ﬁrst paragraph, notwithstanding that the offence so falsely charged may be\\none of those referred to in the second paragraph.260.

When the offence under section 211,\\nIPC, 1860, is committed in relation to Court proceedings, cognizance without Court\\'s\\ncomplaint is barred by section 195 (1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973.263. Since an order of a\\nMagistrate discharging an accused on submission of a police report under section 173,\\nCr PC, 1973, is a judicial and not administrative order, a complaint by the Magistrate or\\nhis superior Court under section 195(1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973, would be necessary to take\\ncognizance of an offence under section 211, IPC, 1860.264. Similarly, remand and bail\\nproceedings too have been held to be Court proceedings and as such a complaint by\\nthe Court would be necessary to take cognizance of the offence under section 211,\\nIPC, 1860.265. This view of the law has now been aﬃrmed by the Supreme Court as\\nwell.266.\\n[s 211.6] Proceedings in any Court.—\\nThere are three situations that are likely to emerge while examining the question\\nwhether there is any proceedings in any Court, namely,\\n(a) there might not be any proceeding in any Court at all,\\n(b) proceeding in a Court might actually be pending at the relevant time when\\ncognizance is sought to be taken of the offence punishable under section 211, IPC,\\n1860 and\\n(c) there might have been proceedings which had already been concluded though there\\nmight not be any proceedings pending in any Court when cognizance of offence under\\nsection 211, IPC, 1860 is taken. It is only in second and third situation that section\\n195(1), Cr PC, 1973 would apply. The fact that proceedings had been concluded would\\nnot be material because section 195(1) does not require that proceedings in any Court\\nmust actually be pending at the time when the question of applying the bar arises if the\\noffence under section 211, IPC, 1860 is alleged to have been committed in relation to\\nthose proceedings.267. A complaint by the concerned Executive Magistrate could be\\nnecessary under section 195(1)(a)(i), and there could be no suﬃcient reason for\\ndispensing with the necessity for a complaint by him for prosecution of an offence\\nunder section 211, IPC, 1860 committed in relation to a proceeding before him under\\nsection 144, Cr PC, 1973.268.\\n[s 211.7] Sections 211 and 500 IPC, 1860.—\\nIf we read sections 211 and 500 of IPC, 1860 together, we would ﬁnd a clear\\ndistinction. Section 211 imposes a punishment in case of a false charge or offence\\nmade with the intent to injure someone before any Court of law, whereas section 500\\nprovides for punishment in case of a defamation of a person by any one.

Section 39 is only a procedural section, violation of which is not made\\npunishable under any penal statute, but, if a person who has knowledge or reasonable\\nbelief that a person is the offender can be treated as a person who is aware of the\\ncommission of the offence and even if he is not punishable for violating section 39 of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure when he harbours or conceals such an offender, he\\nmust certainly be guilty for offence under section 212.286.\\n[s 212.4] Conviction of the person concealed–whether mandatory.—\\nNowhere in section 212 it is stated that the person concealed should be convicted for\\nan offence. Even if the main offender leaves unpunished by the Court, the object of the\\nprovision under section 212 requires that the person who has concealed or harboured\\nthe offender whom he believes and knows has committed the offence shall not leave\\nunpunished if the other ingredients are established. The criminality lies in the act of\\nconcealment committed with the knowledge or belief that the person who is harboured\\nor concealed is the offender and also with the criminal intention of screening him from\\nlegal punishment.287.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 784}),\n",

It is the duty of every State to punish\\ncriminals. No individual has, therefore, a right to compound a crime because he himself\\nis injured and no one else.\\n[s 213.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe section has two essentials:\\n1. A person accepting or attempting to obtain any gratiﬁcation or restitution of property\\nfor himself or any other person.\\n2. Such gratiﬁcation must have been obtained in consideration of (a) concealing an\\noffence, or (b) screening any person from legal punishment for an offence, or (c) not\\nproceeding against a person for the purpose of bringing him to legal punishment. The\\nmost important ingredient of the charge, under section 213, viz., is that the payment\\nwas in relation to the interference with the course of a judicial proceeding and the\\ntampering with the evidence.288.\\n[s 213.2] Scope.—\\nAccording to the Calcutta High Court this section applies only where there has been an\\nactual concealment of an offence, or screening of a person from legal punishment, or\\nabstention from proceeding criminally against a person, and, as consideration for the\\nsame, there has been an acceptance of, or attempt to obtain, or agreement to accept,\\nany gratiﬁcation or restitution of property. It has no application where only an\\nacceptance of or attempt to obtain, or agreement to accept, any gratiﬁcation or\\nrestitution on a promise to conceal, screen or abstain, is proved and nothing more.289.\\nThe Bombay High Court has dissented from this view and has held that this section\\ndoes not require the actual concealment of an offence or the screening of any person\\nfrom legal punishment or the actual forbearing of taking any proceedings. It is\\nsuﬃcient if an illegal gratiﬁcation is received in consideration of a promise to conceal\\nan offence or screen any person from legal punishment or desist from taking any\\nproceedings.290.\\nThe section does not apply where the compounding of an offence is legal.\\n[s 213.3] Mere suspicion.—\\nThis section is applicable only when it is proved that the person screened or attempted\\nto be screened from legal punishment has been guilty of an offence, and not when\\nthere is merely a suspicion of his having committed some offence.291.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 787}),\n",

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch, for \"transportation for life\" (w.e.f. 1 January\\n1956).\\n362. Ibid.COMMENT.—\\nPersons who offer resistance or illegal obstruction to the apprehension of other\\npersons who have committed offences are punishable under this section. The\\npreceding section punishes the offenders themselves. Section 130 deals with rescuing\\na prisoner of State or war and section 186, with rescuing in any other case.\\n\\'Rescue\\' is the act of forcibly freeing a person from custody against the will of those\\nwho have him in custody.366. It has no application to a person who is in lawful custody\\nand who has offered no resistance or obstruction.367. It is also not necessary that the\\nrescuing should be done intentionally for in the second part of this section the word\\n\"intentionally\" has been deliberately omitted. Thus where a person even in order to\\npacify a situation released an accused from the lawful custody of the chowkidar by\\nuntying the turban with which the accused had been tied, it was held that the person so\\nreleasing the accused was clearly guilty of an offence under section 225, IPC, 1860, for\\nrescuing an offender from lawful custody.368.\\nOne can be held guilty for an offence under section 225 if he rescues a person who\\nwas detained lawfully. Here the word \\'rescue\\' though not deﬁned in the Code, will\\nalways mean an act of getting a person free forcibly from custody against the will of\\nperson in whose lawful custody he was. Therefore, some overt act needs to be there, if\\none is said to have rescued a person from the lawful custody.369.\\nWhere the accused obstructed the lawful apprehension of a person and wrongfully\\nconﬁned two police personnel and the evidence of the prosecution was amply\\ncorroborated and supported by medical evidence, conviction and sentence of the\\naccused under sections 225, 332 and 342 was upheld.370. The act for which the person\\nrescued is detained must amount to an offence under the Code. Thus an escape from\\ncustody when being taken before a Magistrate for the purpose of being bound over to\\nbe of good behaviour,371. or an escape from arrest under section 41(2), Criminal\\nProcedure Code,372. will not fall under this section. If the apprehension is not lawful the\\nperson resisting it will not be guilty of any offence.373.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 820}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"There must be an overt act of resistance or obstruction. If a person runs away to avoid\\nan arrest, his act does not amount to resistance or obstruction.375.\\nThe apprehension or detention must be lawful.

A person, about to\\nbe arrested, is entitled to know under what power the constable is arresting him and, if\\nhe speciﬁes a certain power which the person knows the constable has not got, he is\\nentitled to object to such arrest and escape from custody, such custody not being a\\nlawful one. For a charge of escaping from lawful custody the prosecution must ﬁrst\\nestablish that the constable who arrested the man had power to act under the speciﬁc\\nauthority that he claimed to have.379.\\n[s 225B.2] Resistance to improper warrant justiﬁable.—\\nA person cannot be arrested under sections 225B and 353 when the warrant attempted\\nto be executed was addressed to the person with a wrong description to which he did\\nnot answer,380. or when it was illegal owing to want of the seal of the Court,381. or\\nwhen it did not contain the name of the person to be arrested,382. or for any other\\ndefect.383.

Thus,\\nwhere the warrant was signed by a sheristadar who had no authority to sign the\\nwarrant, it was held by offering resistance to arrest under such an illegal warrant the\\naccused did not come under the mischief of this section.385.\\n[s 225B.3] Escape must be from lawful custody.—\\nThe accused was arrested by a Process-Server, and after the arrest he managed to\\nescape from custody, went inside his house, shut himself up there, and refused to\\ncome out. It was held that an offence under section 186 was not established, but that\\nthe accused was guilty of the offence of escaping from lawful custody under this\\nsection.386.

By a notiﬁcation under section 10(1) of The Criminal Law\\nAmendment Act, 1932 the State Government can make an offence under section 228,\\nIPC, 1860, a cognizable offence for a speciﬁed area for such time as the notiﬁcation', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 830}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='remains in force. No Court shall take cognizance of the offence under section 228,\\nwhen such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any\\nproceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of that Court by such oﬃcer\\nof the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court\\nto which that Court is sub-ordinate.389.\\n[s 228.1] Ingredients.—\\nThe essential ingredients of the offence under this section are— (1) intention, (2) insult\\nor interruption to a public servant and (3) the public servant insulted or interrupted\\nmust be sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding.390. The fact that the Court feels\\ninsulted is no reason for holding that any insult is intended.391.\\nThe whole sitting of a Court for the disposal of judicial work from the opening to the\\nrising of the Court is a judicial proceeding, and the necessary interval between the\\nconclusion of one case and the opening of another is a stage in a judicial\\nproceeding.392.\\nActs, such as rude and contumelious behaviour, obstinacy, perverseness, prevarication,\\nor refusal to answer any lawful question, breach of the peace or any wilful disturbance\\nwhatever, will amount to contempt of Court.\\nIf the offence of contempt of Court is summarily dealt with under section 345 of the\\nCriminal Procedure Code, the maximum punishment that can be imposed is ﬁne not\\nexceeding Rs. 200.\\nThe offence under the section is not punishable as contempt of Court. The deﬁnition of\\n\"criminal contempt\" in section 2(c) of The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 includes acts\\nwhich constitute an offence under section 228, IPC, 1860 and also goes beyond such\\nacts, being wider than section 228.393.\\n[s 228.2] CASES.—Contempt.—\\nA person persisting in putting irrelevant and vexatious questions to a witness after\\nwarning;394. a person making an impertinent threat to a witness in the box,395. a\\nperson sentenced to two hours\\' imprisonment and ordered to be kept in custody\\ninsulting the Judge in the grossest manner;396. a person calling the trial Judge as \"a\\nprejudiced judge;\"397. a person stating in an application for transfer of a case that the\\nCourt had become hostile to him;398. and a person insisting upon staying in the Court\\nroom after the presiding oﬃcer of the Court had asked him to leave the Court and after\\nhe had been warned that action for contempt of Court would be taken against him,399.\\nwere all held guilty of contempt of Court under this section. A Commissioner appointed\\nby the Court being a public servant a person who intentionally insults or interrupts him\\nwhile he is sitting in a judicial proceeding commits an offence under section 228, IPC,\\n1860, and should be punished under that section and not under section 345, Cr PC,\\n1973.400. Hurling of shoes by an Advocate at the presiding oﬃcer of the Court was\\ncontempt. Where the party to a case shouted inside a Court room in offensive language\\nas the presiding oﬃcer told that after ﬁling of the rejoinder by the opposite party\\narguments were closed, summary contempt proceedings under section 480 (now\\nsection 345) Cr PC, 1973, read with section 228, IPC, 1860, were fully justiﬁed though in\\nview of the written apology tendered then and there the party should not be convicted\\nunder section 228, IPC, 1860.401.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 831}),\n",

He refused\\nto vacate the seat when asked to do so by the presiding oﬃcer. His conviction under\\nsection 228 was upheld.412.\\n[s 228.6] Free legal assistance.—\\nIt was held in Shrichand v State of MP that the right to free legal assistance has to be\\nconﬁned to the offences that are punishable with substantive sentence of\\nimprisonment. The right to free legal assistance at the State cost could not be\\nextended to an offence under section 228, IPC, 1860 of which the accused was being\\ntried summarily because on conviction he could not have been visited with any\\nsubstantive imprisonment.413.\\n[s 228.7] Insult to Court.—\\nSeveral accused persons faced a trial and were found guilty of various offences. One of\\nthem, on hearing the judgment, addressed to the Court and uttered ﬁlthy abuses and\\nmade contemptuous statements. The Court said that it amounted to an insult of the\\nCourt. The Court had jurisdiction under the section to punish the accused.414. Where\\nan accused wrote a letter to the Magistrate asking him for the reasons as to why he\\nhad returned the petition ﬁled by him and also requested him, to give a copy of the\\ndocument connected with the case, Magistrate found him to be guilty of offence under\\nsection 228, IPC, 1860. But the Madras High Court set aside the judgment by holding\\nthat it may not be said that the letter has been received by the judicial oﬃcer when he\\nwas in any stage of the proceedings in Court and, therefore, the offence under section\\n228, IPC, 1860 is not be made out.415.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 832}),\n",

A presumption can also be\\ndrawn under Explanation 2 of section 28 that a person is counterfeiting coins when he\\ncauses one coin to resemble another so closely that the person intended to practice\\ndeception or knew it would be likely to cause deception. Section 232 prescribes the\\npunishment for counterfeiting Indian coins. Section 235 prescribes the punishment for\\na person who is in possession of any instrument or material used for counterfeiting\\ncoins. Thus, a conviction under sections 232 or 235 would be maintained only if the\\nprosecution satisfactorily proves the ingredients of section 28. The prosecution must\\nestablish that the coins manufactured resemble the original. It must also establish that\\nthere is an intention to deceive, or the knowledge that deception would be caused by\\nsuch resemblance.13.\\n\\'Counterfeiting\\' means causing one thing to resemble another.14.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 847}),\n",

It is an act affecting the\\npublic at large, or some considerable portion of them and it must interfere with rights,\\nwhich members of the community might otherwise enjoy.\\nIt is not a sine qua non that the annoyance should injuriously affect every member of\\nthe public within its range of operation. It is suﬃcient that it should affect people in\\ngeneral who dwell in the vicinity.2.\\nAs to when an individual can bring a civil action in respect of a public nuisance, see the\\nauthors' Law of Torts, 19th Edn, chapter XXI.\\n(2) Private nuisance is deﬁned to be anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the\\nlands, tenements or hereditaments of another, and not amounting to trespass. It is an\\nact affecting some particular individual or individuals as distinguished from the public\\nat large. It is in the quantum of annoyance that private nuisance differs from public. It\\ncannot be the subject of an indictment, but may be the ground of a civil action for\\ndamages or an injunction or both.3.\\n[s 268.1] Liability of owner.—\\nWhere the use of premises gives rise to a public nuisance it is generally the occupier\\nfor the time being who is liable for it, and not the absent proprietor.4.\\n[s 268.2] Civil Remedy.—\\n'Private nuisance' affects some individuals as distinguished from the public at large.\\nThe remedies are of two kinds–civil and criminal. The remedies under the civil law are\\nof two kinds. One is under section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Under it, a\\nsuit lies and the plaintiffs need not prove that they have sustained any special damage.\\nThe second remedy is a suit by a private individual for a special damage suffered by\\nhim.5.\\n[s 268.3] Criminal remedy.—\\nThere are three remedies under the criminal law. The ﬁrst relates to the prosecution\\nunder Chapter XIV of IPC, 1860. The second provides for summary proceedings under\\nsections 133–144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) and the third\\nrelates to remedies under special or local laws. Sub-sections (2) of section 133 of Cr\\nPC, 1973 postulates that no order duly made by a Magistrate under this section shall be\\ncalled in question in any civil court. The provisions of Chapter X of the Cr PC, 1973\\nshould be so worked as not to become themselves, a nuisance to the community at\\nlarge.

The word \"noxious\" as stated in Advanced\\nLaw Lexicon by P Ramanatha Aiyar (3rd Edition Reprint 2009), when used in relation to\\narticle of food is to mean that the article is poisonous, harmful to health or repugnant\\nto human use. Having regard to language used in section 273, noxious food or drink,\\nliterally would mean article of food or drink which earlier was not noxious, but should\\nhave become noxious or had been rendered noxious by lapse of time or by not taking\\nproper precaution or for not adding preservatives or the like.23.\\nWhat is punishable under this section is the sale of noxious articles as food or drink\\nand not the mere sale of noxious article. Where the owner of a grain pit sold the\\ncontents of it before it was opened at a certain sum per maund whether the grain was\\ngood or bad, and on the pit being opened it was found that a large proportion of the\\ngrain was unﬁt for human consumption, it was held that the vendor could not be\\nconvicted under this section.24. Similarly, the selling of wheat containing a large\\nadmixture of extraneous matter, such as dirt, wood, matches, charcoal, was held to\\nconstitute no offence.25.\\nFor local amendments see comment under section 272 ante.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 933}),\n",

Driving of a vehicle or riding on a public way.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 945}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2. Such driving or riding must be so rash or negligent as to endanger human life or to\\nbe likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person.\\n1. \\'Rash or negligent\\'.—Rash and negligent driving has to be examined in light of the\\nfacts and circumstances of a given case. It is a fact incapable of being construed or\\nseen in isolation. The preliminary conditions, thus, are that\\n(a) it is the manner in which the vehicle is driven;\\n(b) it be driven either rashly or negligently; and\\n(c) such rash or negligent driving should be such as to endanger human life.30. The\\ncriminality lies in running the risk of doing such an act with recklessness and\\nindifference to the consequences. The words \"rashly and negligently\" are\\ndistinguishable and one is exclusive of the other. The same act cannot be \"rash\" as well\\nas \"negligent\".31. Where negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence, the\\nnegligence to be established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the\\nnegligence merely based upon an error of judgment. Simple lack of care such as will\\nconstitute civil liability, is not enough; for liability under the criminal law, a very high\\ndegree of negligence is required to be proved.32.\\nThere is a distinction between a rash act and a negligent act. A reckless act has to be\\nunderstood in two different senses—subjective and objective. In the subjective sense, it\\nmeans deliberate or conscious taking of an unjustiﬁed risk, which could be easily\\nforeseen and in the circumstances of the case was unreasonable to take. In the\\nobjective sense, the accused is not conscious of the result though he ought to be\\naware that it might follow and in this sense, it is almost equivalent to negligence. In\\nother words, negligence involves blameworthy heedlessness on the part of the\\naccused which a normal prudent man exercising reasonable care and caution ought to\\navoid. Negligence is an omission to do something, which a reasonable man, guided\\nupon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs,\\nwould do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. A\\nculpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal\\nconsequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the belief\\nthat the actor has taken suﬃcient precaution to prevent their happening. Culpable\\nnegligence is acting without the consciousness, that the illegal and mischievous effect\\nwill follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the\\ncaution incumbent upon him and if he had he would have had the consciousness. As\\nbetween rashness and negligence, rashness is a graver offence.33. Negligence is not\\nan absolute term but is a relative one; it is rather a comparative term. It is diﬃcult to\\nstate with precision any mathematically exact formula by which negligence, or lack of\\nit, can be infallibly measured in a given case. Whether there exists negligence per se or\\nthe course of conduct amounts to negligence will normally depend upon the attending\\nand surrounding facts and circumstances which have to be taken into consideration by\\nthe Court. In a given case, even not doing what one was ought to do can constitute\\nnegligence.34. Absence of high speed itself cannot absolve the petitioner from the\\nculpability.35.\\nThere are several offences in the Code in which the element of criminal rashness or\\nnegligence occurs, viz.,—sections 279, 280, 283–289, 304A, 336, 337, 338.\\n2. \\'Endanger human life\\'.—It must be proved that the accused was driving the vehicle\\non a public way in a manner which endangered human life or was likely to cause hurt or\\ninjury to any other person.36. It is not necessary that the rash or negligent act should\\nresult in injury to life or property.37.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 946}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"[s 279.2] Reasonable care.—\\nThe Court has to adopt another parameter, i.e., 'reasonable care' in determining the\\nquestion of negligence or contributory negligence. The doctrine of reasonable care\\nimposes an obligation or a duty upon a person (for e.g., a driver) to care for the\\npedestrian on the road and this duty attains a higher degree when the pedestrian\\nhappen to be children of tender years. It is axiomatic to say that while driving a vehicle\\non a public way, there is an implicit duty cast on the drivers to see that their driving\\ndoes not endanger the life of the right users of the road, may be either vehicular users\\nor pedestrians. They are expected to take suﬃcient care to avoid danger to others.38.\\n[s 279.3] Mens rea.—\\nThe essential ingredient of mens rea cannot be excluded from consideration when the\\ncharge in a criminal Court consists of criminal negligence.39.\\n[s 279.4] Res ipsa Loquitur.—\\nThis doctrine serves two purposes–one that an accident may by its nature be more\\nconsistent with its being caused by negligence for which the opposite party is\\nresponsible than by any other causes and that in such a case, the mere fact of the\\naccident is prima facie evidence of such negligence. Second, to avoid hardship in\\ncases where the claimant is able to prove the accident but cannot prove how the\\naccident occurred. The Courts have also applied the principle of res ipsa loquitur in\\ncases where no direct evidence was brought on record. Elements of this doctrine may\\nbe stated as:\\n(a) The event would not have occurred but for someone's negligence.\\n(b) The evidence on record rules out the possibility that actions of the victim or some\\nthird party could be the reason behind the event.\\n(c) Accused was negligent and owed a duty of care towards the victim.40. The principle\\nof res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions\\nrelating to negligence.41. This doctrine operates in the domain of civil law especially in\\nthe cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to\\nnegligence. It cannot be pressed 'in service for determining per se the liability for\\nnegligence within the domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited\\napplication in trial on a charge of criminal negligence.42. Where a vehicle was being\\ndriven on a wrong side, accident resulting in the death of two persons, the principle of\\nres ipsa loquitur should have been applied.43. In the case of Thakur Singh v State of\\nPunjab,44. the accused drove a bus rashly and negligently with 41 passengers and while\\ncrossing a bridge, the bus fell into the nearby canal resulting in death of all the\\npassengers. The Court applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur since admittedly the\\npetitioner was driving the bus at the relevant time and it was going over the bridge\\nwhen it fell down.\\n[s 279.5] Abetment.—\\nThe mere fact that petitioner was the owner of the offending vehicle at the relevant\\ntime, ipso facto is not a cogent ground to array him as an accused under section 109\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 947}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='IPC, 1860. In this manner, no offence of abetment is made out against the petitioner.45.\\n[s 279.6] Difference between civil and criminal liability.—\\nThere can be no civil action for negligence if the negligent act or omission has not been\\nattended by an injury to any person; but bare negligence involving the risk of injury is\\npunishable criminally, though nobody is actually hurt by it.\\nIf actual hurt is caused the case would come under sections 337 or 338, and if death is\\ncaused, under section 304A.46.\\nIn a case of collision or injury arising out of rash driving, the actual driver and not the\\nowner of the carriage is liable under this section;47. whereas, in a civil suit, the injured\\nparty has an option to sue either or both of them. In a criminal case, every man is\\nresponsible for his own act; there must be some personal act.48.\\n[s 279.7] Mechanical failure.—\\nPoor maintenance of vehicle is itself a negligent act.49. In cases where the prosecution\\nalleges that the brakes were defective, it must establish by evidence that the brakes\\nwere so defective that the driving of the vehicle endangered human life or was likely to\\ncause hurt or injury to any other person. Merely because the vehicle swerved to the\\nright when its brakes were pulled up, it could not be said that there was danger to\\nhuman life or it was likely to cause hurt or injury to others.50. Failure to apply brakes at\\nrelevant time does not by itself constitute rash and negligent act for it may as well be\\ndue to error of judgment.51. A vehicle of which handbrake and speedometer were not in\\nworking order is a very serious hazard to the public as the driver would never know his\\nspeed. It is a danger to the traﬃc in general.52.\\n[s 279.8] Contributory negligence.—\\nThe doctrine of contributory negligence does not apply to criminal actions.53. The\\ndeceased stood protruding his body out of the vehicle that too having his back towards\\nthe driver, which fact suggests that he himself was quite negligent and responsible for\\nthe accident.54.\\n[s 279.9] CASES.—\\nIn a case the allegation was that the accused, car driver, drove car in a rash and\\nnegligent manner and caused injury to a child who was playing on side of road. But the\\nevidence showed that vehicle was going in middle of road and child was also playing\\non road. Brake skid marks on road were duly depicted in site plan, acquittal was held\\nproper by the High Court.55. Where a tractor driver was driving the tractor at a speed of\\nsix miles per hour at night and a man who was sitting on it in a careless fashion\\nunmindful of bumps and jolts fell down and died, it was held that the driver was not\\nguilty of any rash or negligent act within the meaning of sections 279 and 304A, IPC,\\n1860.56. Where a truck dashed against a cyclist and a cart resulting in injuries to both\\nthe cyclist and the cartman but there was no evidence to the actual dashing of the', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 948}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"truck against the cyclist and the cart and no evidence was either available about the\\nmechanical ﬁtness or otherwise of the truck as the same had been set on ﬁre by an\\nangry mob, it could not be presumed that the truck must have been driven rashly and\\nnegligently merely because two persons were injured. In the circumstances, the\\nconviction of the accused under sections 279 and 304A, IPC, 1860 was set aside.57.\\nMerely because the driver ran away from the spot immediately after the incident, it\\ncould not be said that he must have been driving rashly and negligently.58. Driving at a\\nhigh speed or non-sounding of horn by itself does not mean that the driver is rash or\\nnegligent. Place, time, traﬃc and crowd are important factors to determine rashness or\\nnegligence.59. High speed at a crowded road and pressing a person against a wall in\\norder to save accident was held to be negligence within the meaning of this section.60.\\nTo drive at a high speed on an empty road or at a lonely place is not the same thing as\\ndriving in a crowded city street.61. Crushing a school child while driving past a school\\nwas held to be ipso facto rashness. Everybody is expected to slow down and take extra\\nprecautions near the vicinity of an educational institution.62. The mere fact that there\\nare more than two persons in a two-wheeled vehicle will not make out an offence under\\nsection 279, IPC, 1860 as it by itself does not amount to so rash and negligent an act\\nas to endanger human life, section 279, IPC, 1860 is not attracted where the driving is\\nordinarily rash or negligent. Moreover, if an offence is really made out, then driver alone\\nis responsible and not the pillion rider or riders. Therefore, the police practice of\\napprehending all occupants of the vehicle is deprecated.63.\\n[s 279.10] Site plan.—\\nWhere in a case of rash and negligent driving, the site plan, recovery memo, inspection\\nreport of the offending vehicle were not proved by the prosecution and the investigating\\noﬃcer was also not examined, conviction of the accused was set aside.64. However,\\nSupreme Court in a case held that the site plan only indicates the place where the\\naccident happened and nothing more can be read into it.65.\\n[s 279.11] Hitting from behind.—\\nWhere the truck of the accused, driven rashly and negligently, hit a bullock-cart from\\nbehind killing the buffalo and the cartman, the accused could not be convicted under\\nsection 429 as the mens rea of causing loss was absent. However, his conviction under\\nsections 279 and 304-A was upheld.66. Where the accused, bus driver when attempted\\nto overtake a lorry, on seeing one other bus coming in opposite direction swerved the\\nbus towards the left and came in a violent contact with the victim, a cyclist, the Madras\\nHigh Court held that the very act of the accused in driving the bus and dashing from\\nbehind the cyclist clearly constitutes the rashness and negligence on his part.67.\\n[s 279.12] Section 279 is not a petty offence.—\\n'Petty offence' within the meaning of section 206 Cr PC, 1973 is an offence which is\\npunishable only with ﬁne not exceeding Rs1,000 but does not include any offence so\\npunishable under the Motor Vehicles Act. If so, section 279 IPC, 1860 which is a\\ncognizable offence and which is not an offence punishable only with ﬁne is not a 'petty\\noffences'.68.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 949}),\n",

Any latitude shown to them in that sphere\\nwould tempt them to make driving frivolous and a frolic.71. For lessening the high rate\\nof motor accidents due to careless and callous driving of vehicles, the Courts are\\nexpected to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question\\nof sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the\\noffence if the prosecution is able to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.72.\\nWhere the accused dashed the jeep against a tree, as a result of which one person, who\\nwas travelling in the jeep got injured and died, and another person, who was also in the\\nsame vehicle received injuries, the Supreme Court held that the High Court, without\\nproper appreciation of the evidence and consideration of the gravity of the offence,\\nshowed undue sympathy by reducing the sentence.73.\\n[s 279.15] Whether a Court can convict a person under sections 279 and 337,\\nIPC for commission of the same act of offence and accordingly pass sentence\\nunder both the Sections.—\\nIn this case, as the offence having been outcome of the same act, the Court should\\npunish the accused for one offence and at the same time, while passing the order of\\nsentence, the Court should also consider that when the sentence prescribed under\\nsection 279, IPC, 1860 is a more severe offence than the offence prescribed under\\nsection 337, IPC, 1860 the accused could be punished under section 279, IPC, 1860\\nonly.74. However, in another case, Madras High Court held that simply because\\naccused are found guilty under section 304-A IPC, 1860 and sentence is imposed, there\\nis no embargo for Court to impose separate sentence under section 279 IPC, 1860.75.', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 950}),\n",

By Act 36 of 1969, section\\n292 was amended to give more precise meaning to the word \\'obscene\\' as used in the\\nsection in addition to creating an exception for publication of matter which is proved to\\nbe justiﬁed as being for the public good, being in the interest of science, literature, art\\nor learning or other objects of general concern. Prior to its amendment, section 292\\ncontained no deﬁnition of obscenity. The amendment also literally does not provide for\\na deﬁnition of \\'obscenity\\' in as much as it introduces a deeming provision.108. In order\\nto make the law relating to the publication of obscene matters or objects deterrent, the\\nsection provides for enhanced punishment. The Exception to the original section, which\\nis now redrafted, exempts from the provisions of the section any representation,\\nsculptured, engraved or painted on or in any ancient monument. The possession\\nreferred to in this section connotes conscious possession.109. By Act 25 of 1960, the\\nState of Tamil Nadu has added a new section as section 292A for dealing with printing,\\nof grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for blackmail. The State of\\nOrissa has followed suit by Act 13 of 1962. The intention of the Legislature while\\namending the provision is to deal with this type of offences which corrupt the mind of\\nthe people to whom objectionable things can easily reach and need not be emphasized\\nthat corrupting inﬂuence is more likely to be upon the younger generation who has got\\nto be protected from being easy prey.110. This section was amended by Act XXXVI\\nwhen apart from enlarging the scope of the exceptions, the penalty was enhanced\\nwhich was earlier up to three months or with ﬁne or with both. By the amendment a\\ndichotomy of penal treatment was introduced for dealing with the ﬁrst offenders and\\nthe subsequent offenders. In the case of even a ﬁrst conviction, the accused shall be\\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two\\nyears and with ﬁne which may extend to Rs 2,000.111.\\n1. \\'Obscene\\'.—The word obscenity is not deﬁned in the IPC, 1860. The word \\'obscene\\'\\nwas originally used to describe anything disgusting, repulsive, ﬁlthy or foul. The use of\\nthe word is now said to be somewhat archaic or poetic; and it is ordinarily restricted to\\nsomething offensive to modesty or decency, or expressing or suggesting unchaste or\\nlustful ideas, or being impure, indecent, or lewd.112. The obscene matter in a book must\\nbe considered by itself and separately to ﬁnd out whether it is so gross and its\\nobscenity, so decided, that it is likely to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are\\nopen to inﬂuences of this sort and into whose hands the book is likely to fall. In this\\nconnection, the interests of our contemporary society and particularly the inﬂuence of\\nthe book on it must not be overlooked.113. It was further observed in this case that', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 978}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"merely treating with sex and nudity in art and literature cannot be regarded as evidence\\nof obscenity without something more. It was held that where obscenity and art are\\nmixed, art must be so preponderating as to throw the obscenity into the shadow or the\\nobscenity so trivial and insigniﬁcant that it can have no effect and may be overlooked.\\nWhen treatment of sex becomes offensive to public decency and morality as judged by\\nthe prevailing standards of morality in the society, then only the work may be regarded\\nas an obscene production.114. In considering the question of obscenity of a publication\\nwhat the Court has to see is that whether a class, not an isolated case, into whose\\nhands the book, article or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved\\nby reading it or might have impure and lecherous thoughts aroused in their minds.115. It\\nwas also observed in this case that the question of obscenity may have to be judged in\\nthe light of the claim that the work has a predominant literary merit. Referring to the\\nimpact on the mind of the youth, the Court said:116.\\nWe do not think that it can be said with any assurance that merely because the adolescent\\nyouth read situations of the type presented in the book, they would become deprived,\\ndebased and encouraged to lasciviousness. It is possible that they may come across such\\nsituations in life and may have to face them. But if a narration or description of a similar\\nsituation is given in a setting emphasising a strong moral to be drawn from it and condemns\\nthe conduct of the erring party as wrong and loathsome, it cannot be said that they have a\\nlikelihood of corrupting the morals of, those in whose hands it is likely to fall—particularly\\nthe adolescent.\\nIn KA Abbas v UOI,117. the Supreme Court has called the test laid down in Mishkin's\\ncase118. as 'selective audience obscenity test' and observed as:\\nour standards must be so framed that we are not reduced to a level where the protection of\\nthe least capable and the most depraved amongst us determines what the morally healthy\\ncannot view or read ….\\nThe requirements of art and literature include within themselves a comprehensive view of\\nsocial life and not only in its ideal form and the line is to be drawn where the average moral\\nman begins to feel embarrassed or disgusted at a naked portrayal of life without the\\nredeeming touch of art or genius or social value. If the depraved begins to see in these\\nthings more than what an average person would, in much the same way, as it is wrongly\\nsaid, a Frenchman sees a woman's legs in everything, it cannot be helped. In our scheme of\\nthings ideas having redeeming social or artistic value must also have importance and\\nprotection for their growth.\\nIn the case of Samaresh Bose v Amal Mitra119. wherein the Supreme Court provided the\\nfollowing guidance:120.\\nIn our opinion, in judging the question of obscenity, the judge in the ﬁrst place should try to\\nplace himself in the position of the author and from the view point of the author the judge\\nshould try to understand what is it that the author seeks to convey and what the author\\nconveys has any literary and artistic value. The judge should thereafter place himself in the\\nposition of a reader of every age group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and should\\ntry to appreciate what kind of possible inﬂuence the book is likely to have in the minds of\\nthe readers. The judge should thereafter apply his judicial mind dispassionately to decide\\nwhether the book in question can be said to be obscene within the meaning of the section\\nby an objective assessment of the book as a whole and also of the passages complained of\\nas obscene separately.\\nIt is no defence to a charge of obscenity merely to urge that the information has been\\ncopied from similar works.121.\\nIn Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin, Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin,122. the\\nDelhi High Court felt123. that there was nothing wrong if a sociologist made a research\\non the subject of call-girls in order to know the reasons as to why and how the young\\ngirls fall in this profession and what society could do in order to eradicate or at least\\nminimise the possibility of young budding girls joining the ﬂesh trade. The book was in\\nthe form of interviews with the girls in the profession.

       " Document(page_content='including a description by some girls of their ﬁrst experience with sex. But by far the\\nbulk of the book dealt with the ways and means of running the profession and the\\nmethods of encountering them. Thus, the book was within the scope of clause (a) of\\nthe ﬁrst exception. In Bobby Art International v Om Pal Singh Hoon,124. while examining\\nthe validity of certiﬁcate of exhibition awarded to the ﬁlm \"Bandit Queen\" it was held\\nthat nakedness does not always arouse the baser instinct. In Director General,\\nDirectorate General of Doordarshan v Anand Patwardhan,125. the Supreme Court again\\nreferred to the Hicklin test and observed that the relevant questions are:\\n(a)whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would\\nﬁnd that the work, taken as a whole appeal to the prurient interest.\\n(b)whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual\\nconduct speciﬁcally, deﬁned by the applicable state law,\\n(c)whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or\\nscientiﬁc value.\\nIn the case of Ajay Goswami v UOI,126. the Supreme Court, while recognizing the right of\\nadult entertainment, reviewed the position of law on obscenity and summarized the\\nvarious tests laid down regarding obscenity.\\n[s 292.1] A picture of a woman in the nude is not per se obscene.—\\nUnless the picture of a nude/semi-nude female is an incentive to sensuality or impure\\nor excite the thoughts in the mind of an ordinary person of normal temperament, the\\npictures cannot be regarded as obscene within the meaning of section 292 IPC, 1860.\\nBut where repetitive photographs without any backdrop content are published in a\\nmagazine and nearly l/4th of the magazine consists of nothing but repetitive\\nphotographs of semi-nude women, prominence being to display their breast, there\\nbeing hardly any literary contents in the magazine, the matter loses any literary content\\nand therefore the broad social outlook penned in Ranjit Udeshi\\'s case127. may not be\\navailable as a defence.128. To fall within the scope of \\'obscene\\' under sections 292 and\\n294 IPC, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme end of the\\nspectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisﬁed only when the\\nimpugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person having\\nperverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and debase\\npersons likely to come in contact with the impugned art.129.\\n[s 292.2] Hicklin Test and Community Standard Test.—\\nOne of the tests to be applied to ﬁnd whether an article possesses the standard of\\nobscenity is the Hicklin Test.130. As per this, the test of obscenity is whether the\\ntendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose\\nminds are open to such immoral inﬂuences and into whose hands a publication of this\\nsort may fall. The other test is Community Standard Test, whereby the obscenity has to\\nbe judged from the point of view of an average person, by applying contemporary\\ncommunity standards. In Aveek Sarkar v State of WB,131. the Supreme Court was of the\\nview that Hicklin test is not the correct test to be applied to determine \"what is\\nobscenity\".\\nWhen the name of Mahatma Gandhi is alluded or used as a symbol, speaking or using\\nobscene words, the concept of \"degree\" comes in.

The Supreme Court said it failed to see how the appellant\\'s remarks\\namount to \\'obscenity\\' in the context of section 292 IPC, 1860. It was diﬃcult to\\nappreciate the claim that the statements published as part of the survey were in the\\nnature of obscene communications.\\n[s 292.4] Meaning of the word obscene in sections 292, 293 and section\\n294(b).—\\nThe word \\'obscene\\' is not deﬁned differently in these sections but the punishments\\nwere prescribed differently in other sections depending upon the effect of \\'obscenity\\'\\nthat causes on the viewer or hearer as the case may be. That also would suﬃciently\\nindicate that the said word is to be understood as understood for the purpose of\\nsection 292.134.\\n[s 292.5] Certiﬁcate of Censor Board.—\\nOnce the ﬁlm is given a particular certiﬁcation, no doubt the case of obscenity under\\nsection 292 of the IPC, 1860, cannot be made out when the said ﬁlm is shown to the\\nparticular category for which the certiﬁcate is granted.

The advertiser said that the\\npublication was intended in good faith to promote sale of condoms. The advertisement\\nwas withdrawn because of social objections. The advertiser also apologised. The\\ncomplaint ﬁled by a social worker was no doubt maintainable but it was quashed\\nbecause the complainant\\'s interest should give way to the larger public interest as to\\nwhether prosecution would be proper in the circumstances of the case.141.\\n[s 292.7] For sale.—\\nPossession of obscene objects is punishable if the possession is for the purpose of\\nsale, hire, distribution, public exhibition or circulation. Persons who were found viewing\\nobscene ﬁlms on television with the help of VCR could not be charged for the offence\\npunishable under section 292.142.\\n[s 292.8] Effect upon children.—\\nThe accused could not be convicted of possessing an indecent photograph unless he\\nknew that he had the photograph in his possession. The \"making\" of an indecent\\nphotograph included copying, downloading or storing it on a computer, provided that it\\nwas done knowingly.143.\\n[s 292.9] Pornography, incitement for supply of material.—\\nAct of accused, privately viewing obscene ﬁlm does not constitute on offence under\\nsection 292 of IPC, 1860.144. Mere possession of an obscene cassette by itself does\\nnot amount to an offence punishable under section 292(2) IPC. In the case on hand, the\\naccused was found managing a video shop wherein obscene cassette containing a\\nblue-ﬁlm evidently kept for hire to the potential customers, was found. In such\\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that the possession of the cassette was without the\\nrequisite mens rea or that it and does not attract the ingredients of the offence\\npunishable under section 292 IPC.145. In another case, it was proved that the accused\\nshowed pornographic ﬁlm on the handicam to the prosecutrix. Though the charge of\\nrape failed, conviction under sections 292 and 506 was upheld.146.\\nGenerally, evidence of expert is inadmissible whether an article or book has a tendency\\nto deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read, hear or see the matter in\\nquestion.147. The only exception is where the likely readers belong to a special class\\nsuch as young children,148. In Samaresh Base\\'s case149. the Supreme Court of India\\nconsidered the evidence of two eminent Bengali novelists to determine whether the\\nbook \\'Prajapati\\', a Bengali novel, has a tendency to deprave and corrupt youth, who are\\nlikely to read it and having regard to their evidence decided the case in favour of the\\naccused. It was however held that, though a Court of law may consider the views of\\nreputed authors or leading literatures, the ultimate duty to make a proper assessment\\nregarding obscenity or otherwise of a book rests only with the Court.150. The\\nprosecution need not prove something which the law does not burden it with. As\\nregards the second part of the guilty act (actus reus), i.e. the selling or keeping for sale\\nan object which is found to be obscene, here of course the ordinary mens rea is\\nrequired to be shown before the offence can be said to be complete. Even so, it was', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 982}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='held in this case that in criminal prosecution mens rea must necessarily be proved by\\ncircumstantial evidence alone unless the accused confesses. Thus, it is not required\\nthat prosecution must prove guilty intention to possess or possess for sale, by positive\\nevidence. The Court will presume that the owner of the shop is guilty if the book is sold\\non his behalf and later found to be obscene unless he can establish that the sale was\\nwithout his knowledge or consent. Thus to escape liability he has to prove his lack of\\nknowledge.151. In India, it is also a defence to plead a certiﬁcate given by the Board of\\nCensors. Thus, a certiﬁcate granted by the Board of Censors under section 5A of the\\nCinematograph Act 1952, certifying a ﬁlm to be ﬁt for public exhibition, circulation or\\ndistribution would by virtue of section 79, IPC, 1860, make prosecution under section\\n292, IPC, unsustainable even if the ﬁlm be obscene, lascivious or tending to deprave or\\ncorrupt public morale. This is so as section 79, IPC, (justiﬁcation on ground of bona ﬁde\\nmistake of fact) is exculpatory when read with section 5A of the Cinematograph Act\\nand the certiﬁcate issued thereunder.152.\\n[s 292.10] Obscenity in the internet and other electronic mediums.—\\nsection 67 of the Information Technology Act 2000 is the ﬁrst statutory provisions\\ndealing with obscenity on the Internet in India. Sections 67, 67A and 67B of the\\nInformation Technology Act 2000 deal with obscenity in electronic sphere.\\nIt must be noted that the both under IPC, 1860, and the Information Technology Act,\\n2000, the test to determine obscenity is similar.153.\\nA special law shall prevail over the general and prior laws. Electronic forms of\\ntransmission is covered by the IT Act, which is a special law. When the Act in various\\nprovisions deals with obscenity in electronic form, it covers the offence under section\\n292 IPC, 1860. Once the special provisions having the overriding effect do cover a\\ncriminal act and the offender, he gets out of the net of the IPC and in this case, section\\n292 IPC, 1860. Though charge has not been made out under section 67 of the IT Act,\\nyet the accused-appellant could not be proceeded under section 292 IPC.154.\\nState Amendments\\n(Section 292-A insertion)\\nOrissa.— The following amendments were made by Orissa Act No. 13 of 1962, s. 3 (w.e.f.\\n16-5-1962).\\nIn its application to the whole State of Orissa, after Section 292, insert the following\\nnew section, namely:—\\n292-A.

By Act 36 of 1969 the punishment for the offence is\\nfurther enhanced. On going through section 293, it is clear that a separate penal\\nprovision was made with regard to the sale, exhibition, of such obscene object to any\\nperson under the age of 20 years where as section 292 (1) deals with sale, exhibition,\\nof such obscene object to any person. Therefore, in order to make the provision more\\nstringent and grave insofar as it relates to the sale, of obscene objects to younger\\npersons–aged less than 20 years, a separate penal provision, made applicable in\\nsection 293, was introduced. It is in that context, the word \\'obscene\\' occurring in\\nsection 292(1) is made applicable to section 293 also.158. In a trial for the offences\\nunder sections 292 and 293 of the IPC, 1860, a certiﬁcate granted under section 6 of\\nthe Cinematograph Act by the Board of Censors does not provide an irrebuttable\\ndefence to accused who have been granted such a certiﬁcate, but it is certainly a\\nrelevant fact of some weight to be taken into consideration by the criminal Court in\\ndeciding whether the offence charged is established. The Court must have regard to\\nthe fact that the certiﬁcate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly\\nselected under the statute for the speciﬁc purpose of adjudging the suitability of ﬁlms\\nfor public exhibition, and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal\\ningredients which go to constitute the offences under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC,\\n1860. At the same time, the Court must remind itself that the function of deciding\\nwhether the ingredients are established is primarily and essentially its own function,\\nand it cannot abdicate that function in favour of another, no matter how august and\\nqualiﬁed be the statutory authority.159.\\n[s 293.1] CASE.—', metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 989}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"or uttered in or near any public place, or that it causes no annoyance to others, the\\noffence is not committed.163. To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292\\nand 294 IPC, 1860, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme\\nend of the spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisﬁed only\\nwhen the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person\\nhaving perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and\\ndebase persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art. It must also be\\nremembered that a piece of art may be vulgar but not obscene. In order to arrive at a\\ndispassionate conclusion where it is crucial to understand that art from the perspective\\nof the painter, it is also important to picture the same from a spectator's point of view\\nwho is likely to see it.164. The obscene act or song must cause annoyance. Though\\nannoyance is an important ingredient of this offence, it being associated with mental\\ncondition, has often to be inferred from proved facts. Thus, where a Doctor was ﬁlthily\\nabused in a public place by dragging the name of his wife and he and some members\\nof the public were impelled to complain to the police, it was held that there was\\nsuﬃcient indication of the fact that they were all annoyed even though it was not stated\\nor spoken to by them in their evidence.165.\\n[s 294.1] Public Place.—\\nHotels like the one where cabaret dances are performed and entry is restricted by\\npurchase of the tickets, would still be the public places within the meaning of section\\n294 of the IPC, 1860.166. An offence under the section could not be made out by\\nuttering words in a private garden which was not a public place.167.\\n[s 294.2] CASES.—\\nWhere the accused addressed openly two respectable girls who were strangers to him,\\nin amorous words suggestive of illicit sex relations with them and asked them to go\\nalong with him on his rickshaw, he was held to have committed an obscene act.168.\\nPerformance of cabaret dance devoid of nudity and obscenity according to Indian\\nsocial standards in hotels and restaurants is not liable to be banned or prevented.169.\\n[s 294.3] MF Husain's case.—\\nThe renowned artist MF Husain challenged the summoning orders against him which\\narose from a contemporary painting celebrating nudity made by petitioner.\\nSubsequently in the year 2006, the said painting entitled 'Bharat Mata' was advertised\\nas part of an online auction for charity for Kashmir earthquake victims organised by a\\nnon-governmental organisation with which the petitioner claimed to have no\\ninvolvement. It was stated that the petitioner at no point in time had given a title to the\\nsaid painting. There can be no exasperation caused by viewing such painting on the\\nwebsite for the reason that a person would ﬁrst access such a website only if he has\\nsome interest in art and that too contemporary art, and in case he does view such a\\nwebsite, he always would have the option to not to view or close the said web page. It\\nappeared that the complainants are not the types who would go to art galleries or have\\nan interest in contemporary art, because if they did, they would know that there are\\nmany other artists who embrace nudity as part of their contemporary art. Hence, the\\noffence alleged under section 294 IPC, 1860, could not be made out.170.\", metadata={'source': 'Indian Penal Code Book.pdf', 'page': 992}),\n",

It was held that cabaret dances where indecent\\nand obscene act per se is involved would not attract the provision of section 294 of the\\nIPC without fulﬁlment of its essential ingredients, i.e. Evidence pertaining to\\n\"annoyance to others\". In State of Maharashtra v Indian Hotel & Restaurants\\nAssociation,172. the Supreme Court lifted the ban on dance bars holding that \"we fail to\\nsee how exactly the same dances can be said to be morally acceptable in the\\nexempted establishments and lead to depravity if performed in the prohibited\\nestablishments. Rather it is evident that the same dancer can perform the same dance\\nin the high-class hotels, clubs, and gymkhanas but is prohibited of doing so in the\\nestablishments covered under section 33A of Bombay Police Act, 1951.

Thus, the deﬁnition of 'offence' under section\\n2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences\\nunder other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287.

In order to constitute theft, five factors are essential: dishonest intention to take property, movable property, taking out of possession of another person, without their consent, and some movement of the property. Additionally, Section 380 states that theft in a dwelling house, tent, or vessel used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and a fine. Furthermore, Section 411 states that whoever dishonestly receives or retains stolen property, knowing or having reason to believe it to be stolen, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Finally, Section 418 states that whoever cheats with the knowledge that it may cause wrongful loss to a person whose interest they are bound to protect, shall be punished with imprisonment, fine, or both.'"

      " The Indian Penal Code has several sections that deal with theft. Section 379 states that whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of up to three years, or with a fine, or both. Section 380 specifies that if the theft is committed in a building, tent, or vessel that is used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property, the punishment can extend up to seven years of imprisonment and a fine. Additionally, Tamil Nadu has a state amendment that adds a sub-section (2) to Section 380, which states that theft of an idol or icon from a place of worship can lead to rigorous imprisonment for an unspecified term. Section 411 deals with the receiving of stolen property, stating that whoever knowingly receives or retains stolen property can be punished with up to three years of imprisonment, a fine, or both. Similarly, Tamil Nadu has a state amendment to this section as well, adding a sub-section (2) that specifies punishment for receiving stolen idols or icons from a place of worship. Finally, Section 418 addresses cheating with the knowledge that it may cause wrongful loss to a person whose interest in the transaction the offender was bound to protect. This can lead to imprisonment of up to three years, a fine, or both.\n",

       " 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, here are the answers to your questions:\\n\\n**What is a bail?**\\nA bail, as per Section 446 of the IPC, refers to a surety or bond that an accused person provides to ensure their appearance in court in accordance with the terms of the bail or bond. If they fail to appear without sufficient cause, they shall be punished.\\n\\n**What is anticipatory bail?**\\nI don\\'t know. The context provided does not mention \"anticipatory bail.\"\\n\\n**How do I get a bail?**\\nThe context does not provide information on how to obtain a bail. It only mentions the consequences of failing to appear in court without sufficient cause.\\n\\n**How much I have to pay for a bail?**\\nI don\\'t know. The context provided does not specify any amount related to bailing out or obtaining a bail.\\n\\n**Is that amount refundable?**\\nIf the time limit had been set by the Court for payment of fine and the fine amount is not paid within the time so fixed, then the petitioner-accused has to either surrender before the Court or the prosecuting agency will be in a position to arrest him and produce before Court for his detention in prison for undergoing the default sentence. This implies that any fine related to bail is not refundable.\\n\\n**Can I take bail in advance if I know somebody is going to take a legal action against me (I did not do anything wrong)?**\\nBased on the provided context, there\\'s no information to suggest that taking anticipatory bail is possible. The IPC only discusses consequences of failing to appear in court without sufficient cause.\\n\\n**How long a bail is valid? Does it have some expiry?**\\nUnfortunately, I don\\'t know as this information is not available within the given context.'}"
